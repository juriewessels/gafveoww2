**Introduction:**

Researching German WW2 combat vehicle engines 75 years after the end of the war, is not all that simple. The German Army used a very wide variety of engines during the war, some in very small numbers; some were commercial engines while others were specifically produced for military applications. The majority of their fighting vehicles were powered by some variant of an engine produced by the Maybach company. Maybach produced an almost bewildering array of petrol (gasoline) engines between 1933 and 1945, many just as prototypes or produced in very small numbers; others in enormous numbers. 

Although gross details, such as the type of engine, power, etc. of German WW2 engines are generally available, further technical details such as, for instance, the bore and stroke or displacement of a given engine are sometimes impossible to find. Often details such as the displacement of an engine varies between sources and even gross details such as the number of cylinders, configuration (inline or V-type), or whether the engine was diesel or petrol fuelled may differ between sources. 

The list of engines discussed here is by no means exhaustive. The German forces used trucks from many manufacturers, including vehicles from countries they had occupied or from allied countries, such as Italy. These trucks from Opel, Mercedes, Ford, Magirus, Alfa Romeo, etc., used their own engines. Some of these trucks were converted to “Maultier” halftracks and these were generally powered by the original truck engines. The 6-wheeled armoured cars of the Sd. Kfz. 231 series were developed during the 1930s on the basis of 3 different commercial, truck chassis, i.e. Mercedes, Büssing-NAG and Magirus. Although they were externally similar, the cars were powered by commercial, water-cooled petrol engines from the original manufacturers<sup>(1)</sup>. These included the Mercedes Benz M09 inline (straight) six-cylinder engine of 68 hp (3663 cc), the Magirus Deutz S88 inline six-cylinder engine of 70 hp (4562 cc) and a four-cylinder Büssing NAG engine of 65 hp. The six-wheeled cars were replaced by eight-wheeled examples of the Sd. Kfz 232 series and these were mostly powered by a Büssing NAG V8 engine of 150 or 180 hp<sup>(2)</sup>.

Lesser known vehicles are also not mentioned as the engine details are simply not to be found. Various vehicles from occupied countries were employed by the Wehrmacht and these were powered by their own engines. Some are described here, notably the Czech Praga engines for the Pz. Kpfw 38t and its derivatives, as they were produced in large numbers under German occupation.

Some prototype engine developments that never went into production and of which few, if any, details are known, are also not discussed. During post-war interrogation, Ing. Ernest Kniepkamp referred, for instance, to a M.A.N. V6T11.5/16, V-12, supercharged 2-stroke diesel which was supposed to be ready in 1941 but was still not production ready in 1944. He also mentioned a 30 litre, V-12, petrol engine with rotary valves, designed to produce 900 hp, under development at the Adler works of Auto Union. A single cylinder trial unit produced 87.5 hp, which promised more than 1000 hp for the 12-cylinder engine. This was supposed to run in June 1945 but in Kniepkamp’s opinion, it would have taken three more years to get it production ready<sup>(3)</sup>. 

On the other hand, a number of engines which did not see service in German vehicles but were developed during the war for tank use, and about which more details are known, are discussed. These include powerplants from Daimler-Benz, Porsche, etc. 

Some of the individuals who played an important part in the design, development and production of German armoured vehicles during the war, include Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp, Dr G.Stieler von Heydekampf, Prof. Karl Maybach and Prof. Ferdinand Porsche.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dipl. Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp (1895-30th July 1977.  </span>

Dipl. Ing. H.E. Kniepkamp was enormously influential in the design and development of German combat vehicles during WW2. He joined the Heereswaffenamt in 1926 where he became intimately involved with the development of armoured and tracked vehicles. In 1932 he drafted the first set of guidelines for tanks and halftracks which resulted in the development of the Pz. Kpfw. I and six different sizes of half-tracked prime movers (tractors). He was the designer of the interleaved suspension with large, torsion bar suspended road-wheels (Schachtellaufwerk) seen in vehicles such as the German halftracks, the Panther and the Tiger tanks, and he was closely involved in the development of the semi-automatic Maybach Variorex and Olvar gearboxes. By the end of the war, Kniepkamp had submitted some 50 patents in the field of tracked vehicles. After WW2 he founded an engineering firm that served in a consulting and development role in the field of tracked vehicles. Kniepkamp died in 1977, at the age of 78 years<sup>(4)</sup>.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr Gerd Stieler von Heydekampf (5th January 1905 – 25th January 1983)</span>

Dr Von Heydekampf was born in Berlin, into an old, Prussian, aristocratic, military family. He studied engineering in Germany, emerging with a doctorate in 1929. He then spent several years working in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States). On his return to Germany, he joined the Opel company, Germany’s largest automobile manufacturer at the time, where he became the general manager in 1938. In 1942, he relocated to Kassel, where he became the general manager of the Henschel group of companies. Henschel had by that time become a major tank producer in Germany.

In December 1943, he took over from Dr Ferdinand Porsche as the chairman of the Panzer Kommission. The Panzer Kommission operated under Speer’s Ministry for Armaments and War Production. This meant that Stieler Von Heydekampf was responsible for German tank production in 1944 and 1945. 

After the war, Dr Stieler von Heydekampf joined the NSU company, a manufacturer of cars and motorcycles. NSU was later taken over by Volkswagen, which merged NSU with another VW company, Audi. He stayed on as managing director of NSU-Audi until he retired, after a heart attack, in 1971. He died in 1983.

After the war, Stieler Von Heydekampf was extensively interrogated by British intelligence. Some of the information he provided is referred to in this text<sup>(5)</sup>.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Prof. Dr-Ing. e.h. Karl Maybach (6th July 1879 – 6th February 1960</span>

Karl Maybach was born in Cologne, in 1879. After completing school, he attended the Höhere Machinenbauschule (“Higher Machine Building School”) in Stuttgard and the Polytechnikum in Lausanne. In 1906 he started working for the Daimler-Benz Motoren Gesellschaft. Later he worked in Paris and in 1909 he became the technical director of the engine plant of the Zeppelin airship company. In May 1918, the engine firm was renamed Maybach-Motorenbau Gmbh. Both Maybach and the Zahnradfabrik (ZF) gearbox company were originally part of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH (Zeppelin Airship Company), in Friedrichshafen, on lake Constance.

After the first world war, Germany was no longer allowed to build aircraft or airships and Maybach went on to develop diesel engines for marine applications and for trains. In the late twenties, the company started building luxury cars, the most famous probably being the Maybach DS-8 Typ “Zeppelin”, introduced in 1931. It was powered by the 200 hp, V-12, DSO engine.

His outstanding work in the development of engines for aircraft, airships, road vehicles and trains, was recognised by an honorary doctorate from the Technische Hochschule Stuttgard. 

As the new German Army started rapidly expanding during the thirties, Maybach engines were to be found in most of the tanks and prime movers. By the end of the war, roughly 140.000 engines had been delivered. Aside from engines, the company also developed tank gearboxes, notably the semi-automatic Variorex vacuum operated boxes and the Olvar hydraulic boxes. These were state of the art at the time of their introduction. After the war, the Maybach company reverted to developing high performance diesel engines for trains and ships, as well as automatic gearboxes.

On July 6, 1959, Karl Maybach celebrated both his 80<sup>th</sup> birthday and the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the firm of Maybach Motorenbau. He died in February 6, 1960 in Friedrichshafen. The company continues today as part of MTU, formed by a merger of MAN, Mercedes-Benz and Maybach<sup>(6)</sup>.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Dr Ferdinand Porsche ([3rd sSeptember](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_september) [1875](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/1875) – [30th Januari](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_januari) [1951](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951))</span>

Ferdinand Porsche was an Austrian-German automotive designer who, during the second world war, was both a member of the Nazi Party and the SS, as well as a personal friend of Hitler. He was involved in many vehicle projects during war.

He was born into a metal working family but became interested in mechanical and electrical engineering. He attended the Technische Hochschule in Reichenberg and acquired considerable experience with electrical and hybrid powered vehicles, through the Egger-Lohner electric carriage produced in 1901, and a later hybrid version of this vehicle. Later, he went to work for several automotive companies, including Austro-Daimler, NSU, Zundapp and Merceds-Benz. In 1917, he received an honorary doctorate from the Technical University in Vienna. He received another honorary doctorate in 1924, this time from the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgard, for his part in the development of the two-litre, compressor (supercharged) Mercedes car that won the Targa Florio.

In 1929 he joined Steyr, in Austria for several years, where he designed and developed the Steyr V-8, air-cooled engine that powered the Steyr truck and the Raupenschlepper-Ost. He was an outspoken proponent for air-cooling and undoubtedly influenced Hitler in this respect as well.

Prof. Porsche had joined the Nazi Party before the war and became a personal friend of Hitler. He had a lot of influence and became the president of the Panzer Kommission, but by 1943, he had fallen into disfavour with the Army and with Speer’s Armament’s ministry. In December 1943, he was replaced by Dr Stiele von Heydekampf as president of the Panzer Kommission.

From the post-war interrogation of. Stiele von Heydekampf, it seems that the unhappiness with Porsche stemmed from the fact that he frequently came up with completely new and unorthodox designs, without any regard for past experience or existing production facilities, when a new weapon system was requested. This retarded development and production and, as illustrated by the saga of the Porsche Tiger, the resulting vehicle’s performance was also often  unsatisfactory.  

To quote from Jentz and Doyle’s book on the Tiger II: “Never satisfied with a single design that would lend itself to mass production, Dr Porsche pursued new and unproven inventions in his fixation with obtaining the highest automotive performance possible”<sup>(7)</sup>.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Heereswaffenamt (HWA)</span>

The Heereswaffenamt was the central agency in Germany responsible for the development of armament, ammunition and equipment. It had various departments, such as Waffenamt Prüfwesen (Wa Prüf) 1 (ammunition and ballistics), Wa Prüf 2 (infantry), Wa Prüf 4 (artillery), etc., up to Wa Prüf 12. Wa Prüf 6 was the department responsible for the development of armour and motorised vehicles. This is the department to which Kniepkamp was attached and in which he played a major role<sup>(8)</sup>.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">German tank design philosophy:</span>**

The Germans had a philosophy for tank design which determined, to a large extent, the course of their engine and power train development during WW2. Tanks were basically designed to a certain weight. The design power-to-weight ratio was usually 15-20 metric hp/ton<sup>(9)</sup>. This determined the power of the engine. Within the weight limit, the armour had to be as thick as possible. This in turn meant that everything else had to be as small and as light as possible, including the engine and drive train. 

Horsepower is a function of engine speed, as will be seen later: the higher the rpm (revolutions per minute), the higher the power for a given engine. A given power figure can therefore be achieved either by having a small engine running at high speed, or a large engine running at a lower speed. Clearly, if a compact engine is required, the choice would be to have a smaller engine running at high rpm. 

The choice of a smaller engine has another effect which was regarded as beneficial by German tank designers, at least during the nineteen thirties. If one calculates the torque produced by a hypothetical engine that produces 200 hp at 3000 rpm, one arrives at a torque figure of 475 N.m. For a hypothetical engine producing 200 hp at 2500 rpm, the torque figure is 570 N.m., i.e. 20% higher. The engine producing the required power at lower RPM will be larger, all other factors being the same. A high torque engine also requires more robust drive line components, i.e. gear box, shafting, differential, bevel boxes, final drives, etc. More robust translates into heavier. That means the bigger heavier engine requires bigger, heavier drive line components to cope with the increased torque, for no increase in maximum power available. To stay within the design weight with such larger and heavier drive train components would require the armour to be thinner<sup>(9)</sup>. 

There are several buts and however in this respect though. Torque at the wheels or driving sprockets is more important than absolute horsepower for a fighting vehicle. Fighting vehicles rarely have to run at high speed and high engine revolutions for any length of time. The ability to accelerate rapidly from a stationary position, or to negotiate difficult terrain at low speed is more often required of tanks. For vehicles like trucks or halftracks, the ability to pull heavy loads are important. These activities all demand high torque levels at the wheels or tracks. If a relatively small displacement, high performance, high revving engine is used, the required torque at the wheels can only be achieved by gearing down the engine significantly. To keep such a relatively small, high performance, tank engine running in its optimal revolution range therefore requires a relatively complex gearbox, with multiple gears. 

Panther tanks, for instance, were fitted with ZF AK 7-200 boxes with seven forward gears<sup>(10)</sup>. The later models of the Pz. Kpfw. III were fitted with 10-speed Maybach Variorex SRG 328 145, pre-selector gearboxes, and Pz. Kpfw IV tanks usually had manual ZF SSG Aphon gearboxes with 5 or 6 forward gears<sup>(11)</sup>. The Tigers were fitted Maybach Olvar hydraulic gearboxes, featuring 8 forward and four reverse gears<sup>(12)</sup>. These gear boxes were not cheap or simple, and increased complexity generally leads to reduced reliability. 

It should be noted here that German attitudes to this torque business were ambiguous, or at least changed during the course of the war. In a presentation before the Reichsministerium für Rüstung (Department of Armaments), given by Prof. Dr-Ing. Eberan von Eberhorst, from the Technical University of Dresden, in April 1944, he stated that high torque at low RPM is important in a fighting vehicle engine because of its high tractive power and because it renders frequent gear changing superfluous. He showed that an engine with a 33% increase of torque at low compared to maximum revolutions, will require a 5-speed gearbox to achieve a certain amount of torque at the driving wheels, while a smaller, high performance tank engine, with high torque only at high rpm, will require a 9-speed gearbox to achieve the same performance<sup>(13)</sup>. Torque will be further discussed later.

Aside from a lack of torque at low speeds, light-weight, high performance engines tend to suffer from high thermal and mechanical stress. This can result in poor reliability and this was indeed a major problem with the big Maybach engines, as we shall see.  

Another factor in this equation is the matter of engine dimensions, especially engine length. A bigger, longer engine, will require a longer hull. To stay within a given design weight, the armour then has to be thinner. This explains why 50,000 of the 140,000 Maybach engines built during the war, were built using  a tunnel type crank case where the main bearings run on the web of the crankshaft, resulting in very short overall engine length.

A graph in a German document from 1945 compares the amount of space taken up by the engine compartment in various German and Allied tanks. This is calculated as cubic meter per 100 metric hp<sup>(14)</sup>:

Sherman (Continental radial engine):	0.75 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.

Sherman (Ford GAA):			0.58 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.

M10 (twin GM diesels):			0.9 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.

Russian T34 (V2 diesel):			0.7 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.

Panther (HL230)				0.55 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.

Tiger II (HL230)				0.63 m<sup>3</sup> per 100 PS.	

Note the similarity between the German Maybach engines and the US Ford GAA. This will be discussed later.

	

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Petrol versus diesel engines:</span>**

The term petrol will be used in this document, rather than the American term gasoline.

The German Army used petrol engines for the majority of their combat vehicles during the war. Diesel engines were relatively far and few in between, and were mainly used in trucks, a few halftracks and some armoured cars. No German production tank was powered by a diesel engine but there was interest in diesels from the introduction of the first tank, in 1933, right to the end of the war. This was due to the increased range offered by diesel engines and the perceived decreased likelihood of a tank catching fire after being hit.  

The standard octane rating for German land forces petrol was 74. Due to the relatively low octane rating, compression ratios for petrol engines varied between about 5.6:1 and 6.8:1. 

Octane ratings for petrol (gasoline) used by the Armies of the Allied powers varied from 67-70 octane for British pool petrol, to 80 octane for US gasoline. 

A major problem in Germany during the war was the supply of oil. To add to the supply of natural oil, Germany produced large quantities of synthetic fuel from coal. Initially, it was not possible to produce large amounts of diesel with this technology. By the middle of 1942 however, using the Fischer-Tropsch process<sup>(15)</sup>, it became possible for German industry to produce increasing quantities of diesel and this resulted in increased calls to produce diesel tank engines<sup>(16)</sup>.

In December 1938, design guidelines for the development of diesel engines for tanks were issued by Wa Prüf 6 to German industry. Engines in the following power ranges were required:

Up to 150 hp

150-200 hp

200-250 hp

250-320 hp

320-400 hp

400-650 hp

Maximum power was defined as the maximum power which an engine could sustain for 100 hours of continuous running, without having to be overhauled afterwards. A number of additional requirements were stated, such as the ability to use locally produced diesel, with a cetane rating of 50, a flat torque curve, with a reduction of no more than 10% of torque between maximum rpm and 1/3 of maximum rpm, a maximum weight of 4.5 kg/hp for the smallest engines, and correspondingly less for more powerful units, etc.<sup>(17)</sup>. 

The first effort in Germany to fit a diesel engine in a tank was in 1934, when a Pz. Kpfw. I was fitted with a 45 hp Krupp diesel engine but the engine was simply too weak for the vehicle and no further development took place<sup>(18)</sup>. As early as 1938, the Austrian Saurer Works received a contract to build a 350 hp diesel tank engine. Development work started in 1940 and two engines were actually produced (V-12, 120x160 mm bore and stroke, 21.7 litre displacement, and a weight of 1400 kg). No further development work took place however as there was no need for a 1400 kg, 350 hp tank engine at that time<sup>(19)</sup>.  Note that the 700 hp Maybach HL230 engine also weighed about 1400 kg. 

This illustrates the problems with diesel engines at that period in time. Before efficient and compact supercharging or turbocharging became available, diesel engines were generally much larger and heavier than petrol engines of equivalent horsepower. This was especially true for Germany, where the Maybach company developed very compact and efficient petrol engines. 

Dipl. Ing. Ernest Kniepkamp stated that the German Army demanded that a tank carry enough fuel to operate at “full power” for 5 hours, and that the bulk and weight of a petrol engine plus 5 hours’ worth of fuel was less than the bulk and weight of a diesel engine plus 5 hours’ worth of fuel, despite the substantially lower fuel consumption of the diesel and the smaller radiators<sup>(*)</sup> required for the diesel. Only if the tank was to operate for 10 hours without refuelling, would the bulk of the diesel engine plus diesel be less than that of the petrol engine plus petrol<sup>(20)</sup>.

<sup>(*)</sup>Because the diesel is more efficient, there is less heat shedding with a diesel engine and this requires smaller radiators for cooling.

It is also interesting to note that Kniepkamp was of the opinion that the risk of fire after being hit was no less for a diesel-fuelled tank than for a petrol-engined one. He stated that firing trials showed that both will burn equally readily but petrol did have a greater tendency to explode. Petrol however gave fewer problems than diesel under the extremely cold temperatures encountered in Russia during winter<sup>(21)</sup>.

The British came to the same conclusion regarding tanks catching fire after being hit. They noticed that diesel-engined tanks, such as the Valentine, caught fire just as often as petrol-engined ones. After towing several damaged tanks into the North African desert, stocking them fully with fuel and ammunition and shooting at them until they caught fire, they came to the conclusion that the major cause of catastrophic fire in tanks was the ammunition. Fire was less common in German tanks because their ammunition was stored in lightly armoured bins<sup>(22)</sup>.

In a German report towards the end of the war, it was stated that petrol tank engines used between 6 and 9.5 litres of fuel per metric ton vehicle weight, per 100 km travelled. The Maybach HL230 was regarded as the most economical petrol engine while the British RR Meteor engine of the Cromwell and the 30-cylinder Chrysler multibank engine in the Sherman Vc were the least economical. For vehicles with 4-stroke diesel engines, such as the KV engine used in the T34, and the American T-1020 radial engine, the consumption varied between 4 to 6 litres of fuel per metric ton vehicle weight, per 100 km travelled. The consumption of the two-stroke GM diesel was found to be similar to the German HL230 petrol engine<sup>(23)</sup>. 

In June 1942, the Panzerkommission announced that Hitler had once again demanded the development of air-cooled diesel engines for use in armoured vehicles. Air cooling was regarded as being more reliable than water cooling. As mentioned previously, Prof. Ferdinand Porsche was an exponent of air cooling. He was a personal friend of Hitler and was highly regarded by the latter. It may well be that Hitler’s demand for air-cooled engines was influenced by Porsche.

The firms of Daimler-Benz, KHD, Krupp, Maybach, OAF, Opel, Phänomen, Tatra, Simmering, Steyr and WFI were asked to form a work committee and to share their experiences and ideas on this matter. An overview of the Army’s needs showed a requirement for diesel engines in eight sizes:



1. 30 hp to replace the air-cooled petrol engine of the Volkswagen.
2. 70-80 hp for the Radschlepper Ost, Raupenschlepper Ost, Kettenrad and various trucks.
3. 110-120 hp for trucks, light half-tracks and light armoured cars.
4. 200-220 hp for heavy trucks, medium half-tracks, heavy armoured cars and light tanks.
5. 280-320 hp for heavy half-tracks.
6. 530-570 hp for tanks.
7. 700-750 hp for tanks.
8. 1000-1200 hp for tanks.

To achieve these goals, engines with 3 standard cylinder sizes were to be built, to be used in engines up to 18 cylinders, to achieve the required power requirements. The recommended cylinder sizes were 0.8 litre, 1.25 litres and 2.3 litres. These would produce 13 PS, 20 PS and 30-34 PS per cylinder respectively, without supercharging. It was expected that the largest engine would produce 40-45 PS per cylinder with supercharging<sup>(24)</sup>. 

It should be noted that the output for these engines, in normally aspirated form, would have been about 15-16 PS/litre. For the best performing petrol engines from this era, the output was almost twice that.

Aside from the excellent Tatra V-12 used in the Sd. Kfz. 234 (Puma) armoured car and the 4-cylinder Deutz diesel used in a small number of the Raupenschlepper Ost, none of these envisaged air-cooled diesels ever achieved service. For tank use, the Sla-16 came closest to being production ready.

As mentioned, the Heereswaffenamt (HWA) generally demanded a power-to-weight ratio of 15-20 hp/ton for new tank designs. This was practically never achieved as the tanks inevitably turned out heavier than originally intended, and/or the engines turned out weaker than originally intended. By the end of the war, the German heavy tanks barely managed 10 hp/ton.

The following figures provide a comparison of power-to-weight figures for various Allied and German tanks. They are from a German document, dated 1945, and give the ratio of metric horsepower (PS) to metric ton<sup>(14)</sup>.

British Cromwell (Meteor engine):		22.1 PS per metric ton.

Sherman (Continental radial engine):	13.1 PS per metric ton.

Sherman (Ford GAA engine):		16.2 PS per metric ton.

Sherman (twin GM diesel engines):		13.0 PS per metric ton.

M10 tank destroyer (twin GM diesels): 	14.0 PS per metric ton.

Russian T34/85 (V2, 12 cylinder diesel):	16.8 PS per metric ton.

Panther (Maybach HL230):			15.2 PS per metric ton.

Tiger II (Maybach HL230):			10.0 PS per metric ton.	

The first German tank to go into mass-production was the Pz. Kpfw I (Ausf. A), which went into production in 1934. Just over 800 of these vehicles were produced between July 1934 and June 1936. The little tank weighed 5.4 tons and it was initially powered by a Krupp M305 engine of 57 hp, for a nominal power-to-weight ratio of just over 10 hp/litre. The engine drove a ZF Aphon FG 35 five speed manual gearbox. It was soon found that it was under-powered and that the air-cooled engine tended to overheat. A new, longer chassis was then designed and it was fitted with a larger, water-cooled, Maybach NL38TR engine. This increased the power-to-weight ratio to 15.5 hp/ton<sup>(25)</sup>.

Maybach, by far the most important provider of fighting vehicle engines to the German forces in WW2, did not produce any air-cooled or diesel engines to power vehicles during the war. All their engines were four-stroke, liquid-cooled, petrol engines.

The Pz. Kpfw. II (Ausf. A) entered production in May 1936. It was powered by a Maybach HL57 engine of 130 hp, coupled to a ZF six speed gearbox. This was good for a power-to-weight ratio of 17 hp/ton. Subsequent versions of this tank received the Maybach HL62 of 140 hp but the tanks also became heavier and the power-to-weight ratio decreased to about 11.5 hp/metric ton. The final production version (only 12 produced) of the Pz. Kpfw. II was the Ausf. G, and this was fitted the Maybach HL66P engine of about 180 hp, for a power-to-weight ratio of 16.1 hp/ton<sup>(26)</sup>.

The Pz. Kpfw. III went into production in 1937. The tank remained in production until 1943 but derivatives, such as assault guns and self-propelled artillery, stayed in production until the end of the war. It was initially fitted with a 260 hp Maybach HL108 engine, coupled to a ZF ZFG 75 five speed gearbox. The HL108 engine was later replaced by the ubiquitous HL120 TRM of 300 hp. This was coupled to a Maybach Variorex pre-selector gearbox, with 10 speeds forward and one reverse gear. This complex gearbox was vacuum operated. The Ausf. A weighed 15.4 tons but later derivatives weighed as much as 24 tons. The power-to-weight ratio therefore varied from about 16 hp/ton to as little as 12.5 hp/ton<sup>(27)</sup>.

The Pz. Kpfw. IV was also produced from 1937 and its derivatives stayed in production for virtually the whole war. It used the same engines as the Pz. Kpfw. III, i.e. the Maybach HL108 for early versions and the HL120 for later versions. It used a different gearbox though: the ZF SSG 76 Aphon manual box, with 6 speeds forward and one reverse gear. Some of the later tank destroyer versions weighed as much as 28 tons, for a power-to-weight ratio of barely over 10 hp/ton<sup>(28)</sup>.

The next major tank to enter production in Germany was the Tiger I (Tiger VI Ausf. E). The first prototype entered trials in April/May 1942, and the first eight production samples were delivered in August 1942. This vehicle initially weighed 54 metric tons and was powered by a 210 hp Maybach HL210 P45 engine of 650 hp, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 12 hp/ton. After the first 250 vehicles, the HL210 was replaced by the Maybach HL230 P45 engine of 700 hp. By 1944 however, the combat weight of the Tiger I had increased to  57000 kg. The power-to-weight ratio did therefore not improve significantly. It should also be noted that the HL230 engine was soon limited to 2500 rpm and no more than 600 hp, so that the true power-to-weight ratio for the tank was only about 10 hp/ton<sup>(29)</sup>.

The first four Panther tanks were produced between November 1942 and January 1943. These and following vehicles revealed numerous flaws and defects during testing. These were corrected, as far as possible, during production. The first 250 vehicles were fitted with 650 hp Maybach HL210 engines but this was then replaced in production by the 700 hp Maybach HL230 derivative. By the end of May 1943, the Army had received 250 Panthers powered with the HL210 engine and 118, HL230-engined Panther Ausf. D tanks<sup>(30)</sup>.  

The Panther had a combat weight of around 45 tons, depending on which source one looks at. With the 700 PS Maybach HL230, the power-to-weight ratio was just over 15 PS/ton. With the engine limited to 2500 rpm and a power output of no more than 600 hp, the true power-to-weight ratio was less than 14 PS/ton.

The first production Tiger II (Ausf. B), “King Tiger”, was completed at the end of 1943. It weighed almost 70 metric tons and was also powered by the HL230 engine. At 700 hp, the power-to-weight ratio was 10 PS/ton, but with only 600 hp available, it was less than 9 hp/ton<sup>(31)</sup>.

The Germans realized quite early that they would probably require a tank significantly bigger and heavier than the Pz. Kpfw. I, II, III and IV vehicles. The first mention of a 30-ton tank was in a report of the HWA in October 1935. To power the tank, the development of a 600-700 hp engine was discussed with Dr Maybach. At that stage, Maybach still had to prove that 300 hp could be reached by the V-12 engines then under development. He felt that more than 600 hp was not achievable in a V-12 engine design, using the technology then available. He suggested a V-16 engine but the representatives of the HWA pointed out that a V-16 would require a hull a 0.5 metre longer than for a V-12 design and that the additional power available from a V-16 compared to a V-12 would not increase the power-to-weight ratio as the hull would be significantly heavier<sup>(9)</sup>.

This striving for compact (short) engines is a common theme in German tank design and led to unusual and interesting designs later in the war, such as H-16 or X-16 designs, rather than more conventional V-12 or V-16 engines. In this context, it is interesting to note that radial engines, extensively used by the US to power tanks, are particularly short in overall length. Although Germany did limited experimentation with radial engines in the Panther tank, and that results of these tests were promising, no German tank was ever produced using this type of engine.<sup>(32)</sup>.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Air cooling versus liquid (water) cooling:</span>**

Failures of the cooling system was a major cause of liquid-cooled engine break downs at the time of WW2. This included failure of the water pump, hoses, thermostat, head-gaskets, radiator, etc. Furthermore, the use of various anti-freeze mixtures to prevent the cooling water from freezing in the engine and bursting various pipes or even the engine block, was uncommon in the nineteen thirties and forties. This meant that engines had to be drained after use and refilled before reuse, under freezing conditions. Because of these considerations, there was a perception that air-cooling was superior to liquid cooling for military vehicle engines. Armstrong Siddeley, in Britain, developed several prototype air-cooled tank engines in the 1920s but these were not followed up due to cost constraints<sup>(33)</sup>. 

The US made extensive use of air-cooled radial engines during WW2 and preferred air-cooling to liquid cooling. In 1943, when the decision was made to develop a new range of military engines, including engines for tanks, it was recommended that the engines be air-cooled. This led to the development of the Continental air-cooled petrol and diesel engines, including the iconic AVDS 1790 engine. The only other country that made extensive use of air-cooled tank engines during WW2 was Japan, which used air-cooled diesels in practically all their WW2 tanks, and continued to do so into the eighties of the previous century<sup>(33)</sup>.

The Germans made limited use of air-cooled engines in military vehicles bigger than motorcycles. There was, of course, the little Volkswagen flat-four used in the Kübelwagen<sup>(29.1)</sup>. The Kpfw. I used a larger, air-cooled, boxer engine, the Krupp M305<sup>(30.1)</sup>. Porsche, a great proponent of air-cooling, designed V-10, air-cooled, petrol engines for their version of the Tiger<sup>(33.1)</sup>. Air-cooled diesel engines were also used in the Sd. Kfz. 234 armoured car and in the Raupenschlepper Ost halftrack. 

Under the influence of Prof. Ferdinand Porsche, Hitler demanded air-cooled diesel engines for tank use in July 1942 and again in December 1943. He stated that the engines were required for their greater fuel economy, the reduced fire risk and the greater reliability of air-cooling<sup>(34)</sup>. It is interesting that Dr Stiele von Heydekampf, head of the Panzer Kommission after December 1943, preferred liquid-cooled engines. He felt that air-cooled engines required more space than liquid-cooled ones in view of the greater air-flow requirements. He also stated that such engines were complicated, bulky and suffered from poor valve accessibility<sup>(35)</sup>. Dipl.-Ing. Ernest Kniepkamp also preferred liquid-cooling as air-cooled engines were more expensive to manufacture than similar liquid-cooled models<sup>(36)</sup>.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Turbocharging and supercharging:</span>**

The German term “aufgeladen” translates into “charged” or “pressure charged”. This can refer to pressure charging by either a mechanical supercharger or an exhaust gas driven turbocharger. In this document, the term “supercharging” will refer to mechanical supercharging while “turbocharging” will refer to an exhaust gas driven turbocharger. If neither is fitted, the engine is referred to as “normally aspirated”. In the literature, this is also sometimes referred as an “atmospheric” engine. 

It should be noted that all 2-stroke diesels require a “blower” or supercharger, for normal functioning, not to increase power. A normally aspirated 2-stroke diesel does therefore have a low-pressure supercharger. An exhaust gas driven turbocharger can be added for a further increase in power, although this was not yet available during WW2.

Neither Germany nor the Allies made any use of supercharged or turbocharged petrol or diesel engines in ground vehicles during the war, except for the organic Rootes blower fitted to the GM two-stroke diesel engine. For Germany, the turbocharged, X-16, Simmering-Gras-Pauker engine was almost ready for production at the end of the war (see later).

_SLA-16, X-16 engine_

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fuel:</span> The British term “petrol” is used in this document, rather than the American term “gasoline”. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bore and stroke. Displacement (capacity):</span> 

In this document, the bore (diameter of the cylinder) and the stroke of the crankshaft are given in centimeters. The displacement of a given engine is calculated as follows:

(bore radius, in cm)<sup>2</sup>  x 3.142 x stroke (in cm) x no. of cylinders. 

Example: for a 12-cylinder engine with a bore of 105mm (10.5cm) and a stroke of 115mm (11.5cm): 5.25 x 5.25 x 3.142 x 11.5 x 12 = 11950cc = 11.95 litres.

All displacements are primarily given in litres or cubic centimetres (cc). Where cubic inches are used (c.i.), it is calculated by dividing the displacement in c.c by 16.39. 

Periods are used as decimal separators, i.e. 11952 cc may be written as 11.952 litres. Weights are given in metric ton (tonne), or kilogram (kg).

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Over-square and under-square engines:</span>

If the cylinder bore of a given engine is greater than the stroke, the engine is said to be over-square. If the reverse is true, the engine is said to be under-square. In general it may be said that under-square engines provide greater torque at low rpm while over-square engines can turn at higher revolutions and provide more horsepower without excessive piston speed.

Generally speaking, for petrol engines, under-square was the norm until world war 2. Over-square engines only became more common after the war. Almost all the engines discussed here were under-square units. Diesel engines were always under-square and to this day, truck and military type diesel engines are usually under-square, although fast-revving, car type diesels may be over-square.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Compression ratio:</span>

Because of the low octane petrol used, the compression ratio of almost all the petrol engines discussed in this document all ranged between around 5.5:1 to 6.8:1. The compression ratio of the few diesel engines discussed varied between about 14.5:1 and 18:1.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Power output: </span>

In the table, power is given in kilowatt (Kw) with horsepower (hp) in brackets. Kw is converted to hp by dividing by 0.745. For instance: 100 Kw equals 134 hp. Horsepower figures are generally used in this text as most people are more familiar with this term and horsepower per ton figures are more commonly used, certainly in the English-speaking literature, than Kw/ton. 

In this text, “hp” may refer to imperial horsepower or metric horsepower (PS). “PS” refers specifically to metric horsepower. Most of the figures given are metric horsepower. The difference is not great though. Metric hp = 735 watt (0.735 Kw) and imperial hp = 745 watt (0.745 Kw). Imperial hp values are therefore 98.6% of metric hp values. A hundred metric horsepower equals 98.6 imperial horsepower. For instance: the Maybach HL230 engine used in the Panther and Tiger is stated to develop 700 metric horsepower. This equals 690 imperial horsepower.

The horsepower values used are generally gross hp, i.e. without the power loss due to cooling fans, generators, compressors, etc. Losses to drive these ancillaries can be quite high. The air-cooled Sla-16 engine produced 770 metric hp but the cooling fans absorbed approximately 90 hp at full power<sup>(51.6)</sup>. Early versions of the Porsche 101 air-cooled engine developed 300 hp but used 45 hp to turn the cooling fans. The water-cooled Maybach HL210 engine used in the Tiger I used about 55 of its 650 hp to turn cooling fans when maximum cooling was required<sup>(23.1)</sup>. The WW2 Cadillac Series 42 engine, used in a number of allied armoured vehicles, produced 148 gross hp gross and 110 net hp<sup>(57.1)</sup>.

As has already been mentioned, output figures presented for various engines may vary widely from source to source. For instance: for the widely used Maybach HL120 engine, 265 hp, 300 hp and 320 hp are all given as maximum power figures in different sources. For the Maybach HL45, different sources give 105, 120 or 150 hp as the maximum power. Please go to the appropriate sections for a further discussion of the power differences.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">hp/l (horsepower per litre):</span> This is calculated by simply dividing the maximum horsepower figure by the displacement, in litres. Anything approaching 30 hp/l was regarded as high for the time period in question. It should be noted that power in excess of 30 hp/l, such as developed by the large Maybach engines, was exceptional for tank engines during WW2, and was really only equalled in the fifties. 

Generally, engine output (horsepower) increases as the rpm increases. This is, of course, not unlimited. At the upper end of the hp range, the curve will flatten out. A useful figure to compare the efficiency of various engines is hp/litre/1000 rpm. For instance: the 21 litre Maybach HL210 developed 650 PS at 3000 rpm. That is 31 PS/litre, or 10,3 PS/litre/1000 rpm. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Torque: </span>

Torque is the measure of a force that causes an object to rotate around an axis. It is written as Newton-meter (N.m.) in SI units, or as foot-pounds (ft.lb) in imperial units. It consists of a force component (pound) and a distance (feet). If one applies a spanner (wrench) to a nut and the wrench handle is one foot long, and one applies 100 pounds of force to the end of the handle, the amount of torque applied to the nut is 100 ft.lb (100x1). If the handle is two feet long, one only has to apply 50 pounds to achieve 100 ft.lb of torque (50x2).

In the same way, if 1 kg of force is applied to a lever 1 meter long, the amount of torque applied will be 1 kg.m. One kg.m = 9.8 N.m.

Engine torque is a function of horsepower (or kilowatt) divided by revolutions per minute, multiplied by a constant, to give a result in either ft.lb or N.m. This means that an engine delivering 100 hp at 4000 rpm will generate approximately 180 N.m. of torque, while an engine delivering 100 hp at 3000 rpm, will generate 240 N.m. of torque.

The important issue for a vehicle however is not how much torque the engine generates, it is how much torque is generated at the driving wheels or drive sprocket. This is determined both by the engine torque as well as by the gearing applied. If the 180 N.m. torque engine is directly coupled to the wheels, the same amount of torque will be available at the wheels. If the engine drives the wheels through a 2:1 gear ratio, i.e. at 4000 engine rpm the wheels turn at 2000 rpm, the amount of torque at the wheels will doubled, that is 360 N.m. From this follows that a small engine, running at high rpm, can generate a lot of torque at the wheels if it is geared down a lot. 

In motor vehicles, or tanks, high torque (at the wheels) is required to accelerate rapidly or to traverse difficult terrain. Torque is sometimes referred to as “Büffel Charakteristik” (Buffalo characteristics) in German texts. To achieve a great amount of torque at the wheels or driving sprocket, one either requires an engine which develops high torque at relatively low rpm, or one requires a gearbox with multiple gears. Most favourable is an engine that develops its maximum torque at relatively low rpm so that little down-gearing is required to achieve high torque at the driving wheels. This is usually achieved in engines that have a relatively large displacement for the amount of horsepower produced.

Because torque curves are not available for most of the engines discussed here, torque is calculated at maximum rpm for all engines, for comparison purposes. The values given are therefore not the maximum torque a given engine can produce. Maximum torque occurs at a lower rpm, usually between 50-80% of maximum rpm. This “torque at maximum rpm” figure is unfortunately not a particularly useful bit of information. What is much more interesting, is to know at what percentage of maximum rpm, maximum torque occurs: the lower, the better, is the general rule. Torque curves for the following engines give an idea of the relationship between torque at maximum rpm, the maximum amount of torque available from an engine, and the rpm range where maximum torque develops<sup>(37)</sup>.

Ford GAA: 		Max. rpm: 2600 rpm. Maximum torque occurs at 1450 rpm (55%).

			Torque at 2600 rpm: 1370 N.m. Torque at 1450 rpm: 1535 N.m.

Maybach HL230:	Max. rpm: 3000 rpm. Maximum torque occurs at 2100 rpm (70%).

			Torque at 3000 rpm: 1660 N.m. Torque at 2100 rpm: 1800 N.m.

Meteor Mk. 4B:	Max. rpm: 2550 rpm. Maximum torque occurs at 1600 rpm (62%)

			Torque at 2550 rpm: 1780 N.m. Torque at 1600 rpm: 2100 N.m.

GM 6-71 diesel: 	Max. rpm: 2100 rpm. Maximum torque occurs at 1250 rpm (60%).

			Torque at 2100 rpm: 560 N.m. Torque at 1250 rpm: 660 N.m.

V2 diesel (T34):	Max. rpm: 1800 rpm. Maximum torque occurs at 1100 rpm (60%)

			Torque at 1800 rpm: 1980 N.m. Torque at 1100 rpm: 2400 N.m.

From this it is clear that the torque curve of the Ford GAA, for instance, was superior to those of the Maybach HL230. It also shows the superb torque characteristics of a large, four-stroke diesel engine, like the Russian V2.

As mentioned, torque is measured in foot-pounds (ft.lb) or in Newton-meter. Newton-meter (N.m.) is mainly used in this document. To convert N.m. to ft.lb, divide by 1.35. For instance: 100 N.m. = 74 ft.lb of torque.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">rpm:</span> 

Revolutions per minute.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">mps (mean piston speed)</span>: 



* The higher the rpm for a given engine, the higher the mps will be.
* The longer stroke of an engine, the higher the mps will be at a given engine speed (rpm).

MPS =  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stroke, in meters x 2 x RPM </span>

	                   60

An engine with a stroke of 125 mm will have an mps of 10.4 m/s (meters per second) at 2500 rpm. Increase the engine speed to 3000 rpm, and the mps becomes 12.5 m/s. An engine with a stroke of 150 mm will have an mps of 15 m/s at 3000 rpm.

In general, the higher the mean piston speed, the greater the mechanical and thermal stresses on the engine. In general, for large, commercial, diesel engines, the mps is held below 11.5 m/s but for modern tank engines, a higher figure may be tolerable for a limited period of time. Petrol engines during the war tended have somewhat higher mps figures. Ing. Kniepkamp felt  that the mps should be kept below 15 m/s for high performance, petrol, tank engines<sup>(38)</sup>.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Brake mean effective pressure (BMEP):</span> 

This theoretical figure is the mean pressure which, if imposed on the pistons uniformly from top to bottom of each power stroke, would produce the measured (brake) horsepower of an  engine. It is most often given in Bar or in pounds per square inch (psi), with 1 Bar equal to 14.5 psi. It is a function of the pressure of the combustion gasses in the cylinder. If more fuel is burnt in the combustion chamber during a power stroke, with all other factors remaining the same, more pressure will be generated, i.e. the BMEP will increase and torque output of the engine will increase. If a given amount of fuel is burned more efficiently, the result will be the same. 

Torque is a function of BMEP and displacement while horsepower is a function of torque and rpm. Leaving all the constants and conversion factors out of the equation, the following is true: 

Horsepower	=	Torque x rpm.

Torque 	=	horsepower/rpm

BMEP		=	torque/displacement

Torque		=	BMEP x displacement

BMEP indicates the efficiency of a given engine at producing torque from a given displacement. The power of a given engine is usually given in horsepower (or kilowatt) at a certain rpm. If two engines are the same size and run sat the same speed, but one has a higher BMEP, the engine with the higher BMEP will have more power at the same rpm, i.e. it is more efficient. During WW2, any BMEP greater than 9 Bar in a 4-stroke engine could be considered as excellent. 

There are various ways of calculating BMEP and the various formulas may give slightly differing results. It is also possible to simply enter the required details into one of the “BMEP calculators” found on the net. A typical formula for calculating BMEP is: 

BMEP 	=	<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kw x 60</span>

		L x A x (Cx100) x N/2

Where:

BMEP is given in Bar

Kw = power at given rpm, in kilowatt.

L = length of piston stroke, in metres.

A = surface area of a piston, in m<sup>2</sup>.

C = number of cylinders.

N = rpm. N/2 is used for 4-stroke engines. For a 2-stroke engine, the rpm figure is used unchanged. 

A 2-stroke (two-cycle) engine only requires half the BMEP of a similar-sized 4-stroke engine to produce the same power at the same rpm because a 4-stroke engine only has a power stroke per every two revolutions while a 2-stroke engine has a power stroke with every revolution.

The above formula converts power output, in Kw, to torque, in N.m., and then divides the result by the displacement, number of cylinders and the RPM. The result is modified by constants to give a result in Bar or pounds per square inch (psi). This implies that if the power of a given engine increases, with all other elements remaining constant, the BMEP will be increased. If the power remains the same and the displacement, and/or number of cylinders and/or rpm is increased, the BMEP will be reduced.

A simpler formula that gives similar results is (4-stroke engine):

BMEP (Bar) 	=     	<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Hp x 900</span>

		       	Litre x rpm

For example: The 23 litre Maybach HL 230 produced 700 hp at 3000 rpm.

BMEP 	=	<span style="text-decoration:underline;">700 x 900</span>	=	9.13 Bar

**			**23 x 3000

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The engines:</span>**

The engines below are not listed in any specific order. The Maybach company manufactured a bewildering array of engines for use in German fighting vehicles during WW2. These engines were all petrol fuelled and they will be discussed first, more or less in order of displacement and not chronologically. It is important to note this as two similar sized engines may have distinctly different performance ratings because one is from 1936, for instance, and the other from 1941. The Maybachs are followed by the other petrol engines and then the various diesels. At the end of the list, some contemporary Allied and other post-war engines are briefly discussed, to allow comparison with the German, WW2 engines. 

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Maybach engines:</span>**

After the first world war, the most powerful petrol engines available were those developed for aircraft. Wa Prüf 6 decided, in the nineteen thirties, not to use these large, slow turning, high torque aircraft engines in tanks. The firm of Maybach was then instructed to produce smaller, high performance engines, on the cutting edge of technology, specifically for use in tanks and other combat vehicles. This company became the most important manufacturer of military vehicle engines in Germany, during WW2. 

Numerous Maybach engines were developed during the 1930’s and 1940’s but many did not see production or were only produced in small numbers. Some of the engines that did go into production and service, were unfortunately insufficiently developed and tested, resulting in poor reliability, as we shall see. Because of the enormous demand for engines, Maybach engines were built in at least 8 factories across Germany and Austria during the war. By the end of the war, 140.000 Maybach engines for the German Military had been produced, totalling 40 million horsepower<sup>(39)</sup>.

The German army never succeeded in standardizing on a few powerplants. Aside from the numerous Maybach engines used, many trucks also used their own  engines. The enormous variety of engines used resulted in a logistics nightmare for the German supply organisation and logistics units. 

Maybach vehicle engines were identified by various connotations to indicate their functions and applications.  Some of the abbreviations/attachments used include the following<sup>(40)</sup>.

HL:	High performance engine (Hochleistungsmotor).

NL:	Normal performance engine (Normalleistungsmotor).

P:	Tank engine (Panzermotor).

Z:	Tank destroyer installation (Zerstörereinbau).

S:	Tractor/prime mover installation (Schleppereinbau).

G:	Generator engine (Generatormotor).

TR:	Dry sump lubrication (Trockensumpfschmierung).

TU:	(Tiefes Unterteil) Wet sump engine (deep sump, fitted to some halftracks).

K:	Clutch housing attached to motor (Kupplungsgehäuse).

M:	Magneto ignition (Schnapper Magnetzünder).


R:	Belt driven air compressor (Riemenantrieb). 


U:	Vacuum generator (Umgekehrter Verdichter), to operate a Maybach Variorex transmission (see below).

For instance, a HL42 TRKM engine:		

HL: 	High performance engine.		

42:	Approximate engine displacement of 4.2 litres.	

TR:	Dry sump lubrication.			

K:	Clutch housing.			

M:	Magneto ignition.

HL57 TRR engine:

HL:	High performance engine

57:	Approximate displacement (5.7 litres).

TR:	Dry sump lubrication.

R:	Belt-driven compressor.

The absence of a “K” suggests no clutch housing. In German tanks, the engine was usually positioned at the back of the vehicle with the transmission at the front, between the driver and radio operator/machine gunner. The clutch was part of the transmission. Power was therefore delivered to the clutch and transmission by a shaft running directly from the engine to the clutch housing. There was no clutch housing on the engine itself.

It should be noted that the letter codes were/are not always used or complete. Most authors will simply refer to the “Maybach HL57” engine to indicate the basic engine, without specifying the various attachments or the application. 

Most, if not all, of the Maybach engines discussed here are overhead valve engines, with 2 valves per cylinder. Even the large, powerful HL210 and HL230 engines had 2 valves per cylinder, operated by a single overhead camshaft. This is notable in view of the fact that similar Allied tank engines, such as the Rolls Royce Meteor and the Ford GAF, both derived from aircraft engines, used 4 valves per cylinder, with twin overhead camshafts. Despite this, the big Maybach engines delivered comparable horsepower per litre figures and similar BMEP to the two mentioned Allied engines. 

The list below is certainly not all of the Maybach engines used during WW2 but does include the most numerous engine types. Many books have been written about German WW2 vehicles and data have obviously been taken over by many authors from previous publications. In this process, as mentioned previously, some corruption of the data has taken place and has been perpetuated. As far as possible, data have been corrected and rationalized. 

 



1. Maybach HL30. 

    Introduction:	1940/41


    Configuration: 	Four-cylinder, inline.


    Displacement: 	3.1 litre (189 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 95x110 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		67 Kw (90 hp) at 3800 rpm; 29 hp/litre; 7.6 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque: 		170 N.m. (126 ft.lb) at 3800 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.2 Bar (120 psi).


    mps:		13.2 m/s (43 ft/sec) at 2800 rpm.


    In May 1942, the company of Adler started development of the Leichter Wehrmachtsschlepper (leWS, or lWS). This was a simplified halftrack intended to replace the 1-ton Demag halftrack (Sd. Kfz. 10). Three prototypes were built of which the first two were powered by the HL30. The third prototype had the HL42. Although production was intended to start in early 1943, the project did not advance past the prototypes<sup>(1.1)</sup>.


    Some sources state that the engine was a 4-cylinder<sup>(1.2)</sup>, while others state that it was a 6-cylinder engine<sup>(1.3)</sup>. The displacement is given as 3,11 litres<sup>(1.4) </sup>but unfortunately no other engine details are to be found, i.e. bore and stroke. The 4 cylinders and the bore and stroke given here (95x110) are guess work and are assumed to have been the same as those of the HL45, 6-cylinder engine. In a 4-cylinder engine, this equals 3118 cc.  It is therefore suggested that the HL30 was a 4-cylinder version of the 6-cylinder HL45. 


    These engines were also quite high revving for the time. The high power output is mainly due to the high rpm.

2. Maybach NL38.

    Introduction: 	1935


    Configuration: 	Six-cylinder, inline.


    Displacement: 	3790 cc (231 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 90x100 mm.


    Type: 		Four-stroke.

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">About halftracks:</span>


    Germany developed an extensive array of advanced halftracks (sometimes referred to as “three quarter tracks”) before and during the war. These were known under various designations, i.e. as Sd. Kfz. (Sonderkraftfahrzeug) or as Zgkw. (Zugkraftwagen). Sonderkraftfahrzeug can be directly translated as “special powered vehicle”. It was the German ordnance inventory designation for vehicles specifically built for military purposes and was used for armoured and unarmoured halftracks, tanks, armoured cars, etc. The Sd. Kfz. designations of the halftracks have nothing to do with their size or power.


    Zugkraftwagen, directly translated, means “powered tractor” and this referred specifically to the series of halftracks. For instance, the Sd. Kfz. 10 was also known as the Zgkw. 1, i.e. “powered tractor for pulling 1-ton loads”. 


    Sd. Kfz. 10 -   Leichter Zgkw. 1 (light tractor, for 1 ton).


    Sd. Kfz. 11 -   Leichter Zgkw. 3 (light tractor, for 3 tons).


    Sd. Kfz. 6	-   Mittlerer Zgkw. 5 (medium tractor, for 5 tons).


    Sd. Kfz. 7	-   Mittlerer Zgkw. 8 (medium tractor, for 8 tons).


    Sd. Kfz. 8	-   Schwerer Zgkw 12 (heavy tractor, for 12 tons).


    Sd. Kfz. 9	-   Schwerer Zgkw 18 (heavy tractor, for 18 tons).


    sWS	-   Schwerer Wehrmachtschlepper. This vehicle was developed from 1942 as a simplified halftrack intended for pulling loads up to about 6 tons. It only entered production at the end of 1943 and about 1000 units were built. The maximum pulling weight was 8 tons. It never received an Sd. Kfz. designation.

    “Maultier” (Mule) was a generic term for a halftrack conversion of a standard truck. Many of these were built for service in the difficult conditions on the Eastern front and they were based on a number of different trucks, including Opel, Magirus Deutz, Mercedes and Alfa Romeo. Initially, the trucks were fitted with suspension units from Pz. Kpfw. 1 or Pz. Kpfw. 2 tanks but later a standard conversion employing a Horstman type suspension was used. This suspension was very similar to that used on the British Universal carriers (Bren carriers). The Maultier conversions used the standard truck engines.

    sWS	  13500 kg.		8000 kg.	HL42 TKRMS, 100 hp.


    NOTE: Most of the halftrack models were fitted with more than one model of engine, depending on when they were built, with later built vehicles receiving later and more powerful engines. The Sd. Kfz. 10, for instance, was initially fitted with the NL38 TRKM engine and later with the HL42 TRKM. The Sd. Kfz. 7 started life with the HL52 engine. This was later replaced by the HL57, then by the HL62 and finally with the HL64, in 1943. The big Sd. Kfz. 9 initially had the HL98, later the HL108 and finally, the HL120.


    A number of these vehicles were fitted with partial or completely armoured bodies, or otherwise served as the basis of armoured vehicles. This usually resulted in the Sd. Kfz. number changing as numbers from 1 to 99 were used to designate unarmoured halftracks, 100 to 199 were used to designate tanks and tank-derived vehicles and 200-299 were used to designate other armoured vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers, armoured half-tracks, armoured cars, etc.


    The light Sd. Kfz. 10 halftrack gave rise to the Sd. Kfz. 250 series of armoured reconnaissance halftracks while the Sd. Kfz. 11 gave rise to the many Sd. Kfz. 251 variants, mostly used as APCs. Some sWS vehicles were fitted with armoured cabs, as were some of the other heavy halftrack variants.

4. Maybach HL45. 

    Introduction:		1940


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		4.68 litres (285 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 95x110 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel			Petrol (gasoline).


                    Power:                              93 Kw (125 hp) at 3800 rpm. 28.7 hp/litre; 7.6 hp/litre/1000 


                    rpm.


    Torque:			250 N.m. (185 ft.lb) at 3800 rpm.


    BMEP:			8.0 Bar (115 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	13.9 m/s (45 ft/s) at 3800 rpm.


    Used in the Pz. Kpfw. I, Ausf. C (VK 6.01) and Ausf. J (VK 18.01). Also in the HK p602 (DEMAG) and p603 (Hanomag) prototype halftracks (modified Sd. Kfz. 251). Widely varying power outputs reported by various sources: 105<sup>(4.1)</sup>; 120<sup>(4.2)</sup>; 150<sup>(4.3)</sup>. It is certainly not 105 hp. That would have been very low for a Maybach engine of this displacement, developed in 1940, and would have left the mentioned vehicles badly under-powered. An output of 150 hp would result in 32 hp/litre but in view of the high rpm, this was possible. The output was probably in the 120-150 hp range, at 3800 rpm. Also see the notes on the HL90 and the HL100.

5. Maybach HL50. 

    Introduction:		1941.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		5 litres (305 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 100x106 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


    Power:			135 Kw (180 hp) at 4000 rpm. 36 hp/litre; 9 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			285 N.m. (210 ft.lb) at 4000 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.2 Bar (105 psi).	


    Mean piston speed:	14.1 m/s (46 ft/s) at 4000 rpm.


    Used in the HKp605/606 simplified halftrack prototypes to replace the Sd. Kfz. 251, developed by DEMAG, and the prototypes of the “Kätschen” fully tracked APC (1944)<sup>(5.1)</sup>. These vehicles were not produced in quantity. High power to displacement ratio and high maximum rpm.


    The displacement of the engine is given as 4995 cc by various sources. The bore and stroke are nowhere to be found. A bore and stroke of 100x106mm equals the known displacement of 4995 cc and is the same as the bore and stroke given for the HL90, and/or the HL100 (which see). Hundred and eighty horsepower from a 5-litre military engine is (very) high for this period. Note that the US Chrysler Military V8 petrol engine of the 1950’s displaced 361 c.i. (5.9 litres) and developed 191 gross horsepower at 4000 rpm. This was also on higher octane petrol than that used in Germany during the war. The 180 hp figure given for the HL 50 may therefore be too high. The figure of 9 hp/litre/1000 rpm is however possible; the HL210 produced 10 hp/litre/1000 rpm. Moore suggests that the V12, HL90 developed 320 hp. This would put the HL50 at 160 hp, which is probably more realistic. Also see the notes about the HL90 and HL100<sup>(5.2)</sup>.

6. Maybach HL52. 

    Introduction: 		1934.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		5.2 litres (316 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 100x110 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	86 Kw (115 hp) at 2600 rpm. 22.2 hp/litre; 8.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			315 N.m. (230 ft.lb.) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.6 Bar (110 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	9.5 m/s (31 ft/s) at 2600 rpm.


    Used in early prototypes of the Sd. Kfz. 7, between 1934 and 1935<sup>(6.1)</sup>. Replaced in this vehicle by the HL57 in 1935, by the HL62 in 1937 and by the HL64 in 1943<sup>(6.2)</sup>. 


    This early engine produced only 22 hp/litre, at least in part due to the low maximum rpm. 

7. Maybach HL54. 

    Introduction: 		1935.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		5.4 litres (330 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 100x115 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	90 Kw (120 hp) at 2600 rpm. 21.2 hp/litre; 8.15 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			330 N.m. (245 ft.lb.) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.6 Bar (110 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	9.9 m/s (32.5 ft/s) at 2600 rpm.


    This engine was identical to the HL52, but with the stroke increased by 5 mm. The HL54 TUKRM was used in later versions of the Sd. Kfz. 6, (Zgkw. 5t), 5-ton halftrack. The earliest versions of the Sd. Kfz. 6, in 1935, were powered by a Maybach HL 35 engine (no details known). This was replaced by the HL 38 in 1936 and in 1939 the HL54 followed. This final version of the Sd. Kfz. 6 was also longer, with 2 extra road wheels<sup>(7.1)</sup>. The model shown below is the later, longer version.

8. Maybach HL57. 

    Introduction: 		1936.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		5.7 litres (347 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 100x120 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	97 Kw (130 hp) at 2600 rpm. 22.8 hp/litre; 8.7 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			330 N.m. (245 ft.lb.) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.9 Bar (115 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	10.4 m/s (34 ft/s) at 2600 rpm.


    The same bore as the HL52 and HL54, but the stroke increased by another 5 mm over the HL54. Used in the Pz Kpfw IIa, and in the Sd. Kfz. 7 (Zgkw. 8t) from 1936 to 1938. In the Pz Kpfw II, it was replaced by the Maybach HL62, from chassis nr. 21001, to create the Ausführing b version of the tank<sup>(8.1)</sup>. In the Sd. Kfz. 7, the HL57 was in turn replaced by the HL62, in 1937. The final version of this vehicle received the HL64, in 1943<sup>(8.2)</sup>.

9. Maybach HL62. 

    Introduction: 		1936/37


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		6.2 litres (384 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 105x120 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	105 Kw (140 hp) at 2600 rpm. 22.6 hp/litre; 8.7 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			380 N.m. (280 ft.lb.) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.7 Bar (112 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	10.4 m/s (34 ft/s) at 2600 rpm.


    Similar to the previous three engines, but with the bore increased by 5 mm. Used in the Pz Kpfw IIb-f and in the Sd. Kfz. 7 halftrack (Zgkw. 8). The Pz Kpfw II (Ausf. b) weighed 7.9 tons. This resulted in a favourable power-to-weight ratio of 17 hp/ton<sup>(9.1)</sup>.


    It was also used in the prototype of the 15cm sIG33 auf Fahrgestell Pz. Kpfw. II but production vehicles were powered by a Büssing-NAG engine<sup>(9.2)</sup>.

10. Maybach HL64. 

    Introduction: 		1939.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		6.45 litres (412 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 105x125 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	120 Kw (160 hp) at 2800 rpm. 24.7 hp/litre; 8.8 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			410 N.m. (305 ft.lb.) at 2800 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.9 Bar (115 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	10.8 m/s (35.5 ft/s) at 2800 rpm.


    Again, an incremental increase in displacement, with the stroke increased by 5 mm over that of the HL62, and a slight increase in maximum rpm. Used in the Sd. Kfz. 7, eight ton halftrack, from 1943 onwards.<sup>(10.1)</sup>. 

11. Maybach HL66. 

    Introduction: 		1939.


    Configuration:		Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement:		6.75 litres (410 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 105x130 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline).


                Power:	135 Kw (180 hp) at 3200 rpm. 26.6 hp/litre; 8.3 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:			390 N.m. (290 ft.lb.) at 3200 rpm.


    BMEP:			7.3 Bar (106 psi).


    Mean piston speed:	13.8 m/s (45 ft/s) at 3200 rpm.


    An increase of 5 mm of the stroke length, compared to the HL64, and 20 hp more output. It was used in a number of experimental upgraded versions of the Pz. Kpfw. II.


    The VK9.01 (Pz. Kpfw. II Ausf. G) was a redesign of the Pz. Pkfw. II with the intention of increasing the top speed. The resulting tank had interleaved, large road-wheel, torsion bar suspension and was powered by the HL66P engine. It weighed 10.5 tons, for a power-to-weight ratio of 17 hp/ton. Although a prototype ran in 1939, production was delayed due to many modifications and eventually, only 12 were produced between April 1941 and February 1942.


    The VK9.03 (Pz. Kpfw. II Ausf. H and M) was to have been the production version of the VK9.01. It was similar in design to the VK9.01 but was more heavily armoured and had a different transmission. Like its predecessor, production was delayed at first, and then cancelled completely.


    The VK13.03 (Pz. Kpfw II Ausf L), also known as the Luchs (Lynx) was a variant of the Pz, Kpfw. II designed to be a fast reconnaissance tank. It was a further development of VK9.03, with a similar Schachtellaufwerk (interleaved, large road wheels) suspension and the Maybach HL66P engine, but more heavily armoured. The first 100 vehicles were to be produced with the 20 mm KwK L/55 cannon and after that, with the 50 mm KwK 39/L60. Only the first 100 vehicles were however produced before the order was cancelled.


    With the HL66, the power-to-weight ratio was 16.2 hp/ton. <sup>(11.1)</sup>. The engine had two overhead valves per cylinder, 8 journal bearing, i.e. conventional bearings, not the roller units found in the V-twelves. It was fed by two Solex 40 JFF, down draught carburettors<sup>(11.2)</sup>.


    Notable for this engine is the increase of 20 hp (12.5%) for an increase of only 300 cc displacement (4.6%), compared to the HL64 engine. This was achieved by allowing the engine to run up to 3200 rpm instead of 2800 rpm. As can be seen by the hp/litre/1000 rpm figures and the BMEP, the efficiency was no better than that of the HL62 and HL64, and the mean piston speed ended up being quite quite high.

12. Maybach HL85. 

    Introduction:		1938


    Configuration: 		V-12


    Displacement: 		8.5 litres (520 c.i). Bore and stroke: 95x100 mm.


    Type:			Four-stroke.


    Cooling:			Liquid.


    Fuel:			Petrol (gasoline)


                Power: 	138 Kw (185 hp) at 2600 rpm. 21.7 hp/litre; 8.3 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque: 			170 N.m. (126 ft.lb) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP: 			7.5 Bar (109 psi)


    Mean piston speed:	8.7 m/s (28.5 ft/sec) at 2600 rpm.


    This engine was developed from the Maybach DSO 8 engine. The DSO 8 was a V-12 engine used in the Maybach “Zeppelin” sportscar, where it developed 200 PS. In military guise, it developed 150 PS at 2000 rpm. The DSO 8 displaced 7978 cc from a bore and stroke of 92x100<sup>(12.1)</sup>.


    The HL85 powered the Sd. Kfz. 8 (Zgkw. 12t), 12-ton, heavy halftrack<sup>(12.2)</sup>. This vehicle was initially built in 1934, powered by the 150 hp Maybach Type DSO 8 engine<sup>(12.3)</sup>. In 1938, the DSO engine was replaced by the HL85 TUKRM.

    This engine was used in prototypes of the light field howitzer leFH 18/40 L/28 mounted on the hybrid Pz. Kpfw. III/IV chassis. Two companies built prototypes of a _Waffentrager _in which a 105mm gun (10.5 cm leFH 18/40 L/28) was mounted on a hybrid Pz. Kpfw. III/IV chassis in such a way that it could be removed and fired off the ground. Rheinmetall-Borsig built 10 prototypes of which the first two were powered by the Maybach HL66 engine and the next 8 by the HL90P20k engine of 320hp<sup>(13.1).</sup> Krupp built prototypes of a competing design, the “10.5 cm. leFH 18/6 auf Waffenträger Geschütswagen III/IV (Heuschrecke)”. Ten of these vehicles were produced in the final months of 1943 and production was intended to start at the end of 1944 or beginning of 1945. In the end, neither of these vehicles went into production however, as they did not provide significant advantages over existing vehicles. 


    Some sources state that the Heuschrecke prototypes (Krupp) were also powered by the HL90<sup>(13.2)</sup> and that the production vehicles were to have been powered by the HL100 engine of 420 hp<sup>(13.3)</sup>. Moore however states that the Heuschrecke prototypes were powered by the standard 300 hp, HL120 TRM engine<sup>(13.4)</sup>. 


    The HL90 engine was also used in the Flakpanzer für S FlaK (8.8 FlaK auf Sonderfahrgestell). This was a modified chassis based on the Pz. Kpfw. IV. Initially, it mounted an 8.8cm FlaK 36 L/56 anti-aircraft gun. This was later replaced by the 8.8 cm FlaK 41 L/75<sup>(13.5)</sup>.


    There are some incongruities concerning this engine. The displacement is given as 9990 cc by all available sources<sup>(13.6)</sup>. This is, incidentally, exactly twice the displacement of the 6-cylinder HL50, which was also introduced in 1941. If this displacement is correct, the designation HL90 for this engine would not conform to the standard Maybach nomenclature. It seems possible/likely that the bore and stroke of the HL90 may actually have been 95x110, i.e. the same as the HL45, resulting in a displacement of 9356 cc. This would suggest that the four-cylinder HL30, six-cylinder HL45 and the twelve-cylinder HL90 were all part of the same engine family, with the same bore and stroke. This is speculation however. 


    Various power outputs are mentioned for the HL90 engine: 200<sup>(13.7)</sup>, 320 hp<sup>(13.8)</sup> or 360 hp<sup>(13.9)</sup>. Two hundred hp is certainly too low and incorrect. The most likely figure is 320 hp at 3800 rpm. At a displacement of 10 litres, this would be 32 hp/litre which is high but not impossible. At 360 hp it would have been 36 hp/litre which would have been very high for a military engine from this era. The highly rated HL210, developed at about the same time, developed 30.5 hp/litre at 3000 rpm. The stated output of the HL45 was 150 hp. If the HL90 was indeed a V-12 version of the 6-cylinder HL45, the output would have been around 300-320 hp. This, again, is speculation but does conform to the data provided by Moore.


    The authorative book by Von Senger und Etterlin, “Die Deutschen Panzer”, refers to the HL90 as a six-cylinder engine<sup>(13.10)</sup>. All other sources however state that it is a 60° V-12 unit<sup>(13.11)</sup>.

In 1939 it was replaced by the Maybach HL108 in this vehicle<sup>(14.1)</sup>. The Zgkw. 18 was the biggest and most powerful of the German halftracks.

    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)

    BMEP: 		8.9 Bar (130 psi).


    Mps:		13.3 m/s (43 ft/sec) at 4000 rpm.


    In 1941/2, Prof. Maybach suggested that the plethora of engines being produced during the 1930s and early 1940s could be markedly reduced by using just a few models. He proposed 4 engines:  a 4-cylinder HL 33, a 6-cylinder HL50, an 8-cylinder HL 67, and a 12-cylinder HL100. These engines would share as many parts as possible (pistons, sleeves, valves, rocker arms, connecting rods, bearings, etc.), and they would all have the same bore and stroke<sup>(15.1)</sup>. The single cylinder displacement would have been about 830 cc. 


    Spielberger’s book on the Panther depicts a diagram, by Maybach, showing the development of tank engine compartment size relative to horsepower between 1935 and 1942. The engines are stratified chronologically. For the period 1935-1938, the NL38 and the HL62, HL120, HL190 and HL320 engines are mentioned. For the period 1938-1940, the HL45, HL66, HL116, HL150 and HL224 engines are included. For the period 1941/42, the HL50, HL100, and HL230 engines are mentioned. Interestingly enough, the HL90 engine does not feature in this diagram. In the diagram, Maybach suggested that the HL50 would produce 200 hp and the HL100, 400hp<sup>(15.1)</sup>. 


    As previously discussed, it seems unlikely that HL90 displaced 9990cc as presented in most sources. The 9990 cc engine was most likely the HL100. Spielberger gives 9990 cc as the displacement for both the HL90 and the HL100<sup>(15.2)</sup>. It seems that the HL50 and the HL100 were new engines developed in 1941/42, with relatively short strokes (106 mm) to allow high rpm and high power output, and that they were part of the building block (Baukastensystem) series of new engines proposed by Maybach. With a relatively short stroke, the mean piston speed was kept low despite high maximum revolutions (12,6 m/s at 4000 rpm). According to the presentation by Maybach, these engines were to have produced about 33 metric hp per cylinder (40 PS/litre), i.e. 130 PS for the 4-cylinder, 200 PS for the 6-cylinder, 265 PS for the V-8 and 400 PS for the V-12. 


    The high power output (40 hp/litre) was mainly due to the high maximum RPM which was in turn made possible by the relatively short stroke. The hp/litre/1000 rpm and the BMEP figures are high but no higher than those of the contemporary Maybach HL210 engine.

    Used in the Pz. Kpfw. III Ausf. A-D, the Pz. Kpfw. IVa and the Sd. Kfz.9 (Zgkw. 18t) 18-ton halftrack. In the tanks, the HL108 was replaced by the HL120 in 1937, and in the halftrack, in 1938<sup>(16.1)</sup>. 


    The HL108 was, like the later V-12 Maybachs, a 60° V-12 utilising a tunnel type crankcase, with 7 roller main bearing, and two overhead valves per cylinder, activated by one overhead camshaft per head. Compression ratio 6.5:1. It was fed by two Solex JFF2 down-draught carburettors.


    Although the cooling arrangements differed between the Pz Kpfw III and IV, in both vehicles it was designed to provide adequate cooling to 30°C (85°F)<sup>(16.2)</sup>.


    As for most of these engines, reported output varies from source to source. Typical was 250-260 at 3000 rpm maximum, and 230 hp at 2600 rpm, continuous rating<sup>(16.3)</sup>.

17. Maybach HL 116. 

    Introduction:	1938


    Configuration: 	Six-cylinder, inline.


    Displacement: 	11 litres (675 c.i.). Bore and stroke:125x150 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		225 Kw (300 hp) at 3300 rpm. 27 hp/litre; 8.2 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque: 		650 N.m. (480 ft.lb) at 3300 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.0 Bar (115 psi)


    Mps:		16.5 m/s (54 ft/sec) at 3300 rpm.


    In 1938, Daimler Benz was awarded a contract to design a new tank to replace the Pz. Kpfw. III. By December 1938, they had completed the design of the VK 20.01(III). It was one of the first tanks to be fitted with a Schachtellaufwerk suspension of large, interleaved roadwheels, based on the Kniepkamp designed suspension found on the various German halftracks. The VK 20.01(III) was to be powered by either a Mercedes diesel engine or by a Maybach, 6 cylinder petrol engine, the Maybach HL 116, which developed 300 PS at 3300 rpm<sup>(17.1)</sup>. This tank never went into production.


    In January 1937, Wa Prüf 6 of the Heereswaffenamt instructed Henschel to produce a chassis for a 30-ton tank, and Krupp to develop a turret, mounting a short-barrelled 75 mm gun. This tank was initially referred to as the “Begleitwagen” (B.W.) (escorting vehicle), later as the “Infanteriewagen” (I.W.) (infantry tank) and finally as the “Durchbruchswagen” (D.W.) (breaching tank). In November 1939 the design came to be referred to as the VK 30.01(H); the “H” for Henschel. Two chassis were constructed by Henschel: D.W. 1 and D.W. 2, both powered by the Maybach HL120 engine. Following testing of these vehicles, Henschel redesigned the chassis and fitted a new engine, the Maybach HL 116. Both the Maybach HL190 (375 PS) and the HL150 (400 PS) were suggested as possible alternative powerplants for this vehicle<sup>(17.2)</sup>.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span> Thomas Jentz mentions that Krupp also started the development of a new tank, the VK 20.01(K), in May 1940. Krupp created sketches of a chassis that could mount either the Maybach HL 116 or the HL 115<sup>(17.3)</sup>. No other information is available about an “HL 115” engine; it is almost certainly a misprint for HL150. The proposed VK 20.01(K) never saw the light however. 


    The HL 116 engine was installed in the 3 prototype chassis of the Henschel VK 30.01, in 1941/2, coupled to a Maybach Variorex gearbox in 2 vehicles and an Olvar gearbox in the third. The Variorex gearboxes were semi-automatic, pre-selector boxes that utilised vacuum created by the engine to operate the gearbox<sup>(17.4)</sup>. The Olvar transmissions were similar to the Variorex but utilised oil-pressure (hydraulics) to effect the gear changes<sup>(17.5)</sup>.


    The proposed 30 ton, Pz. Kpfw. VI tank never went into production. The six prototype Krupp turrets for the 30-ton tank were incorporated into the Atlantikwall. One chassis was used for trials and as a base tractor while 128mm guns were mounted on two chassis to create Panzerselbstfahrlafette für 12,8 K40 self-propelled guns<sup>(17.6)</sup>.


    Some sources give a maximum output of 320 hp and/or a maximum rpm of 3300 for the HL 116<sup>(17.7)</sup>. In his book on the Tiger I, Jentz suggests 300 hp/3000 rpm<sup>(17.8)</sup>. At 3300 rpm, the mean piston speed would have been 16.5 m/s. This is excessive. At 3000, it would have been 15 m/s; still quite high. It is possible that the engine could indeed produce 300-320 hp at 3300 on a test bench but in practice, the maximum allowable rpm would have been 3000, with the maximum sustained rpm being about 2500 (about 250 hp). This puts it in the same class as the HL120, V-12 engine. 


    Some authors have suggested that the engine might have been a V-12<sup>(17.9)</sup>. This is incorrect; it was an inline (straight) 6-cylinder engine<sup>(17.10)</sup>. Maybach Motorenwerk produced three HL 116 engines in 1940, eleven in 1941, three in 1942 and a single one in 1943<sup>(17.11)</sup>.

    Although the VK30.01 never went into production, it is part of the genealogy of the Tiger I tank. “VK” stands for “Vollketten”, i.e. “fully tracked”. The first numeral states the ball park intended weight of the vehicle, in this case 30 tons, while the second numeral is for the first prototype design.


    VK designations were used when tank chassis were ordered or in development. Numerous “VK’s” were developed or proposed during WW2, for instance the VK6.01, VK9.01, VK16.01, VK16.02, VK18.01,VK30.01, VK45.01, etc. 


    As described above, the VK30.01 chassis developed from the B.W. (verstärkt), I.W., and D.W., with a turret by Krupp, mounting a 75mm gun. In June 1940, a requirement arose for a tank in the 30-ton class mounting a 105 mm infantry support gun, in a turret with 10 cm armour. The tank would weigh around 36 tons and became known as the VK36.01. In May 1941, the idea for the low velocity gun was dropped and it was decided to arm the tank with the high velocity, taper bore, Waffe 0725. It was to be powered by a Maybach HL174 engine of 450 hp, through a Maybach Olvar 40 12 16 transmission and Henschel L600 steering gear. The vehicle had eight pairs of large, interleaved (geschachtelde) road wheels and torsion bar suspension. A single VK36.01 chassis was completed (see later, under the Maybach HL174 heading)<sup>(17.12)</sup>.

    _Artist’s depiction of the proposed VK 36.01_


    In 1939, Porsche was allowed to independently design a 30-ton tank. This vehicle became the Typ 100, or VK30.01 (P). Only a single chassis was built. When the decision was made to mount the 88mm L56 KwK 36 gun on a tank, Porsche redesigned the Typ 100 into the 45 ton Typ 101 (VK45.01 (P)) and designed a suitable turret. The turret was built by Krupp.<sup>(17.13)</sup>. This design eventually turned into the Ferdinand (Elephant) tank destroyer (see under Porsche Typ 101 engine).


    Henschel competed for the same contract to design a tank mounting the 88 mm L56 gun. When Porsche redesigned their VK 30.01(P) into the VK45.01(P) for this contract, Henschel redesigned their VK36.01(H) to become the heavier VK45.01 (H), similar in appearance to the VK36.01, but bigger and heavier. It was designed to accommodate the same Krupp turret, mounting the 88/L56 gun. This vehicle finally became the Tiger I. 



18. Maybach HL120: 

    Introduction:	1936/1937


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	12 litres (11950 cc) (729 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 105x115 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		225 Kw (300 hp) at 3000 rpm. 25 hp/litre; 8.4 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		710 N.m. (525 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		7.5 Bar (109 psi).


    Mps:		11.5 m/s (38 ft/sec) at 3000 rpm.


    This engine was used in numerous armoured vehicles, including the Pz. Kpfw. III (Ausf. d-n), the Pz. Kpfw. IV (Ausf. b-j), and their many derivatives, in the Ferdinand tank destroyer (Panzerjäger Tiger (P)), the Waffenträger prototypes (Hummel/Wespe SPG), in later versions of the Sd. Kfz. 9 heavy halftrack, etc. 


    The engine was a 60° V-12, four-stroke unit, with a tunnel type crankcase and seven roller main bearings, usually with a dry sump. It sported two overhead valves per cylinder, driven by a single, gear-driven, overhead camshaft per bank. Weight was approximately 940kg and the compression ratio was 6.5:1. Reported output varies a bit, depending on source, but typical was 300 metric hp at 3000 rpm and 265 hp at 2600 rpm continuously<sup>(18.1)</sup>. Other sources give a maximum output 320 hp. Von Senger, for instance, gives 320 PS at 3000 rpm, with a maximum torque of 800 N.m.<sup>(18.2)</sup>.


    The engine was usually fitted with two starters: an electric starter to use when the engine was warm and an inertia starter for use when the engine was started from cold. The inertia starter was accessed through the rear armour by means of a crank. A flywheel was then spun up, usually with two men on the crank. When the flywheel had reached about 60 rpm, the crank was removed and the clutch between the flywheel and engine engaged. The momentum of the flywheel then turned the engine over to start it. The HL210 and HL230 engines of the Panther and Tigers had similar starting systems<sup>(18.3)</sup>.


    The Pz. Kpfw. IV was fitted with a small, two-stroke, auxiliary generator to keep the batteries charged<sup>(18.4)</sup>. This improved starting with the self-starter. The Pz. Kpfw. III did not have this feature. As a further aid to cold starting on the Eastern front, a “Kühlwasserübertragung” was fitted. This allowed the cooling circuit of a warm engine to be connected to that of a cold engine in another tank and to heat the engine of this second vehicle by means of the hot cooling water<sup>(18.5)</sup>.


    The HL120 is possibly the most prolific of the Maybach engines produced and was used in numerous vehicles<sup>(18.6)</sup>.

    It is interesting to note that the Germans had access to a full range of engines between 90 and 700 hp. This was not the case with the Allies. Many engines were available up to about 150 hp, but between 150 hp and 350 hp, there was a distinct dearth of powerplants to power armoured vehicles in the Allied armies.


    In view of the extremely widespread use of the HL120, it is interesting to note that the Allies never developed a “conventional” 250-300 hp class engine for use in armoured vehicles, except the rather obscure 16 litre, flat-12, Meadows DAV engine used in the rather obscure Covenanter tank. They (Allies) did however make widespread use of radial aircraft engines of 250 hp and of 340-400 hp, and they had the excellent GM two-stroke diesel which varied between 135 and 210 hp, but because of the fuel policy, this engine saw relatively little use as a tank powerplant with the US and Commonwealth forces.


     


    To achieve the required power, the Allies (Americans) often made use of double engine installations, such as two Cadillac series 42 engines in the M24 light tank, two Hercules JXD engines in the T17 armoured car, two GMC 270 engines in the Staghound armoured car, two GMC 329 engines in the Boarhound armoured car<sup> </sup>and two GM Diesel 6-71 diesels in some Sherman tanks<sup>(18.7)</sup>. 


    The British also built six prototypes of what was basically a copy of the German Sd. Kfz. 7 halftrack. This “Traclat” was powered by two, side by side, Bedford engines<sup>(18.8)</sup>. The only twin engine installations used by the Germans, was the petrol-electric setup in Porsche’s proposal for the Tiger I. This was continued in the Ferdinand SPG.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

19. Maybach HL150: 

    Introduction:	1939.


    Configuration: 	Inline six-cylinder engine.


    Displacement: 	15.9 litres (970 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 150x150 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		300 Kw (400 hp) at 3400 rpm. 25.1 hp/litre; 7.4 hp/litre/1000 rpm


    Torque:		840 N.m. (620 ft.lb) at 3400 rpm.


    BMEP: 		6.6 Bar (96 psi).


    Mps:		17 m/s (56 ft/sec) at 3400 rpm.


    Three engines were proposed for the prototype of the VK 30.01(H). First choice was the V-12 Maybach HL190 of 400 hp at 2500. As a back-up, Maybach developed a big six-cylinder engine, the HL150. Finally, a more compact 6-cylinder motor was developed, the HL 116<sup>(19.1)</sup>. The HL150 had the same 150 mm stroke as the HL 116 but the bore was increased to 150 mm. Two prototype engines were built but the engine saw no service use. 


    Both the HL 116 and the HL150 had 150mm strokes and had published maximum rpm in excess of 3000. This would have resulted in very high mean piston speed and there is good reason to believe that continuous rpm would have been substantially lower, if they had gone into production. Jentz states that the HL150 engine developed 400 metric hp<sup>(19.2)</sup> while Fröhlich mentions 320 hp<sup>(19.3)</sup>. Horsepower is more or less proportional to rpm. It may be that the engine did indeed produce 400 hp at 3400 rpm on the test bench and that it produced 320 hp at a more realistic 2800 rpm, for instance. 

20. Maybach HL157: 

    Introduction:	1940/41	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	15.6 litres (950 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 115x125 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		410 Kw (550 hp) at 3500 rpm. 35.2 hp/litre; 10 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1120 N.m. (830 ft.lb) at 3500 rpm.


    BMEP: 		9.4 Bar (136 psi).


    Mps:		14.6 m/s (48 ft/sec) at 3500 rpm.


    This engine was intended for the VK16.02 light tank. This was to be a fast, 22-ton reconnaissance tank, with production starting in 1943, but it was cancelled before even one prototype was produced. It is not clear whether a prototype of this engine actually ever ran.


    The output of 35 hp/litre is very high, but the BMEP and hp/litre/1000 rpm figures are similar to those of the contemporary HL210 and would have been achievable. The high output is mainly due to the high maximum rpm. At 3500 rpm, the mean piston speed would have been 14.6 m/s, similar to the 14.5 m/s of the Maybach HL230 at 3000 rpm. That engine could not tolerate the high rpm however and its maximum RPM had to be limited to 2500 rpm. In practice, the HL157 would probably have developed about 450 hp at 3000 rpm<sup> (20.1)</sup>.

    Displacement: 	17.4 litres (1075 c.i.)? Bore and stroke: 115x140 mm?


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		335 Kw (450 hp) at 3000 rpm. 25.6 hp/litre; 8.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1070 Nm. (790 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		7.6 Bar (110 psi).


    Mps:		13.0 m/s (42.6 ft/sec).


    As described in the section for the HL115, Wa Prüf 6 requested Krupp to design a new turret with 10 cm thick armour, to house a 105 mm L/28 gun. In mid-1940, Wa Prüf 6 ordered Henschel to redesign the Durchbruchswagen (D.W.) hull to mount the new turret. The new tank was to be powered by a drive train consisting of a 12-cylinder engine, the Maybach HL174, delivering 450 hp, driving through an eight-speed Maybach Olvar 40 12 16 transmission and Henschel L600 steering gear and final drives. The weight of the tank would be around 36 tons and the proposed prototype became known as the VK36.01. Only a single VK36.01 chassis was built and the design developed into the VK45.01(H), which became the Tiger I. Maybach Motorenwerk reported that only two HL174 engines were built in 1942<sup>(21.1)</sup>.


    Most sources state that the bore and stroke for the HL174 were 125x130 mm, for a displacement of 19144 cc<sup>(21.2)</sup>.  This would however not conform to the standard nomenclature used by Maybach for their engines, and 450 hp from a 19-litre engine is rather mediocre, if one compares it with the other late model V-12 engines from Maybach. Jentz suggests a maximum output of 500 hp and 28.7 hp/litre. This presupposes a displacement of 17.4 litres. The bore and stroke given in the table (115x140), for a displacement of 17.4 litres, are a “guestimate”. 


    The actual output of the engine is also not quite clear. Jentz suggests both 450 hp and 500 hp, while Chamberlain states 550 hp<sup>(21.3)</sup>. An output of 550 hp is unlikely as that would result in well over 30 hp/litre. In the table, 500 hp at 3000 rpm is used while calculations are based on 450 hp at 3000 rpm in this section.. 


    It seems that there has been some confusion about the data for the HL174 and the HL190 in the past and that this has been propagated afterwards by many authors. Both of these engines were only produced in very small numbers; they were basically developmental engines.

    BMEP:		7.4 Bar (110 psi).


    MPS:		10.4 m/s (34 fps) at 2400 rpm.


    Little data available for this engine. Jentz states that is was suggested as a possible powerplant for a proposed 30 ton tank in 1935<sup>(22.1)</sup>. He gives the power as 375 PS for an output of 19.7 hp/litre, with no further details as to bore and stroke<sup>(22.2)</sup>. Von Senger und Etterlin states that the engine weighed 1200 kg, displaced 19 litres and developed 400 PS<sup>(22.3)</sup>. 


    The bore, stroke and even the displacement are not clear. Most authors state that the bore and stroke of the HL174 were 125x130 mm. This equates to a displacement of 19144 cc and were probably the bore and stroke of the HL190. 


    The maximum rpm stated for the HL190 is low, at 2400, as is the power output, as one can expect from an engine from that era. 


    The HL190 was a candidate to power the Henschel VK 30.01 but the prototype of this vehicle finally received the more compact HL 116<sup>(17.2)</sup>.

23. Maybach HL210: 

    Introduction:	1942	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	21355 cc (1300 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 125x145 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Compression:	6.8:1


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		485 Kw (650 hp) at 3000 rpm. 31 hp/litre; 10.3 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1540 N.m. (1140 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		9.3 Bar (135 psi).


    Mps: 		14.5 m/s (48 ft/sec) at 3000 rpm.


    Development of this 60° V-12 started in June 1941. It is probable that the decision of Henschel to upgrade the VK30.01 to the VK36.01, in May 1941, led Maybach to develop this engine. The first pre-production engines were delivered to Henschel and MAN in February 1942; an extremely short development cycle. The first tank to be fitted with this engine was the Tiger Mod. E (Tiger I). The first prototype of this tank took to the road in April 1942, followed by 5 more in June 1942<sup>(23.1)</sup>. These vehicles were fitted with the HL210 TRM P45 engine:


    HL:  Hochleistungsmotor (High performance engine).


    210: 21 litres displacement.


    TR:  Trockensumpfschmierung (Dry sump lubrication system).


    P45: Panzermotor (tank engine), for a 45 ton tank.


    The version used in the first batch of Panther Ausf. D tanks differed in some details from the Tiger version and was known as the HL210 P30, the “P30” signifying a 30 ton tank. The first Panther (Ausf. D) was delivered in January 1943.


    The HL210 engine consisted of a cast aluminium crankcase with steel cylinder liners and cast iron heads. It was a very compact unit for the amount of power it delivered, being just over 1.2 metres (48 inches) long, 97 cm. (38 inches) wide and 94 cm (37 inches) high, excluding the air-cleaners. The short-block weighed about 800 kg. With all accessories attached, the weight was about 1050 kg. The compression ratio was 6.8:1<sup>(23.2)</sup>. 


    The HL210 engine was used in the first 250 Tiger I tanks and the first 250 Panther tanks. It was then replaced in production by the HL230. The engine was fed by four Solex, down draught carburettors (JFF 2) which draw combustion air through 3 Mahle, vortex type air-filters, with oil baths. The 3 air-filters distinguish the HL 210 from the later HL 230 which only had two air-filters on top in the Tiger and a single, large, combined unit in the Panther. Fuel was supplied by 4 mechanical fuel pumps. In addition, an electrical as well as a manual priming pump was available. Two overhead valves per cylinder were actuated by a single overhead camshaft per bank. The camshafts were gear driven. One spark plug per cylinder was supplied by one ignition magneto per bank, i.e two, six-wire magnetos. The oil tank for the dry sump lubrication system contained 28 litres of oil and the oil was cooled via an oil-water heat exchanger. The engine was fitted with a 24 volt electric starter as well as an inertia starter which could be swung by a crank handle through the rear wall of the engine compartment<sup>(23.3)</sup>. 


    The HL210 engine had a very high output per displacement and BMEP for an engine from this era. Power at maximum rpm was 650 metric hp. It soon became clear, as in the case of its HL230 derivative, that the engine was not reliable or durable at 3000 rpm and the maximum rpm was limited to 2600 rpm. Maximum continuous power was about 570 hp at 2600 rpm<sup>(23.4)</sup>.

24. Maybach HL224: 

    Introduction:	1938	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	Probably 22.3 litres (1360 c.i.), Bore and stroke: 130x140 mm.


    			Possibly 21.4 litres (1300 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 125x145 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		450 Kw (600 hp) at 3000 rpm. 27 hp/litre; 9 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1420 N.m. (1050 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.0 Bar (116 psi).


    Mps: 		14 m/s (46 ft/sec) at 3000 rpm.


    Installed in one or two prototype VK 65.01 chassis. Three prototypes of this large tank were ordered in September 1939. The initial prototype was to be powered by a Maybach HL320 and the following two by an even larger HL 360 engine. The specifications of these engines are not known. Eventually, only one or two mild steel prototypes were completed in mid-1941, powered by the HL224 engine. The tank was notable for the ability to be broken down into 3 sections for rail transport: the driver and co-driver compartment and transmission in the front section, the fighting compartment with turret in the centre section and the rear section containing the engine<sup>(24.1)</sup>.


    The bore, stroke and displacement of the HL224 are usually stated to be (125x145) with a displacement of 21.4 litres, i.e. identical to that of the HL210<sup>(24.2)</sup>. This confusing situation is also seen with the other large, experimental Maybach engines, i.e. the Maybach HL174 and the HL190: all available sources state that the bore and stroke of the HL174 was 125x130 mm which equals 19.1 litres; no displacement figures are available for the HL 190, and the HL224 is stated to have an identical displacement to the HL210. These numbers are almost certainly incorrect. If the engine conformed to the normal Maybach designation, the bore and stroke of the HL224 would have been 130x140, with a displacement of 22.3 litres. 

25. Maybach HL230: 

    Introduction:	1943	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	23098 cc (1410 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 130x145 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Compression:	6.8:1; later 6.4:1.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		520 Kw (700 hp) at 3000 rpm. 30.4 hp/litre; 10.1 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1660 N.m. (1230 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		9.1 Bar (132 psi).


    Mps: 		14.5 m/s (48 ft/sec) at 3000 rpm.


    **Note:** For the greatest part of its career, the HL230 produced about 575 hp at 2500 rpm. If the figure is used, the following specifications are true:


    Power:	428 Kw (575 hp) at 2500 rpm. 25 hp/litre; 10 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    It soon became clear that the Tiger I was under-powered with the HL210 engine. The engine compartment in the tank was however designed around the very compact HL210 engine and it would not have been possible to fit a physically larger engine without a major redesign of the hull and engine compartment. To address this problem, the HL230 engine was developed. It was derived from the HL210, by replacing the aluminium engine block of this engine by a heavier and more rigid cast iron block, and increasing the bore to 130mm. This raised the displacement from 21.35 litres to 23.1 litres. The engine had the same configuration as the HL210, with some differences in the positions of the magneto’s, the air cleaners, etc<sup>(25.1)</sup>. At around 1400 kg it was substantially heavier than the aluminium HL210. Compression ratio initially was 6.8:1, later reduced to 6.4:1.


    Like the HL210, the HL230 was a dry sump engine. The oil reservoir was a 28 litre tank fitted low down, on the right side of the engine. Oil circulation was maintained by a single pressure pump and two scavenge pumps that returned oil from the sump to the oil tank. As in the HL210, the oil was cooled by an oil-water heat exchanger. An interesting feature of the HL230 was that it had a valve through which lines from the two fuel pumps passed on their way to the four carburettors situated in the V. An oil line also passed through the valve mechanism. If the oil pressure dropped below a certain level, the valve would close and shut off the fuel flow, ensuring that the engine stopped before serious damage could ensue.


    The two starters, one electric (24 volt) and one inertia, were mounted on the side of the engine, in front of the oil tank. According to the handbook, the engine had to be started using the inertia starter when it was cold. The electric starter was only intended for use with a warm engine. 


    To use the inertia starter, a crank handle was passed through the armour at the rear of the tank. It engaged a gear and shaft system that connected it to the inertia starter. The shaft actually passed through a tunnel in the oil tank on its way to the starter. The flywheel of the inertia starter was spun up with the crank handle. The handle was then disengaged and a lever situated next to the crank opening in the rear armour pulled to engage the flywheel to the engine<sup>(25.2)</sup>.


    The HL230 engine required 30 litres of engine oil while the Maybach Olvar gearbox and the steering gear required another 30 litres of oil. The final drives, turret drives and fan drives required a further 57 litres of oil<sup>(25.3)</sup>.


    The HL230 replaced the HL210 in production in May 1943, in both the Panther Ausf. D and the Tiger I<sup>(25.4)</sup>. The first 250 Tigers were fitted with the HL210 engine. After this the HL230 was fitted. When the earlier tanks required new engines, the HL210 units were replaced by HL230 ones. This involved some modification of the engine compartment, especially of the cooling fan drives. Kits were supplied to enable these replacements to be performed in the field.


    Various versions of the engine were used in the late production Tiger I, the Tiger model B (Tiger II/King Tiger) and its derivatives, like the Sturmtiger, various versions of the Panther and its derivatives (Jagdpanther; Bergepanther, etc.). It was also intended for future projects such as the Panther II and the E-100, at least initially<sup>(25.5)</sup>.


    In all the German tanks, the engine was situated at the back while the transmission was fitted at the front of the vehicle, between the driver and co-driver/radio operator. German tank designers felt that this gave better weight distribution than with a complete powerpack at the back of the vehicle. It also allowed the engine compartment to be shorter and the turret to be mounted further back on the vehicle which, in the case of a long main gun, gave less gun overhang. Finally, it was felt that having the drive sprocket at the front of the vehicle gave certain advantages, such as reduced wear and tear of the sprocket because the track was cleaner by the time it reached the sprocket. The US also followed these design principles in the Sherman, the M2 and M3, etc., until the introduction of the M26. This had the engine, gearbox, steering gear, final drives and drive sprockets at the rear.


    The biggest disadvantage of a rear engine with a front mounted gear box is that a drive shaft has to pass from the engine to the gearbox, passing underneath the turret basket. The overall height of the vehicle is inevitably increased by this construction. In tanks with a transverse torsion bar suspension, such as the German “big cats”, the drive shaft also has to pass over the torsion bars and under the turret basket, potentially raising the height even more.


    In the Panther, the engine was coupled to ZF AK 7-200 transmission. This was a full syncromesh, manual gearbox with 7 speeds forward and one reverse gear. The gearbox was rated for a maximum of 800 PS and maximum torque of 1750 N.m. With the three disc dry clutch, it weighed 750 Kg. This gearbox proved to be generally effective, easy to use and reliable in the Panther<sup>(25.6)</sup>.


    In the Tiger Ausf. E (Tiger I), the HL230 was coupled to a Maybach Olvar 40 12 16A semi-automatic, hydraulically shifted gearbox, with eight forward and four reverse gears. In the Tiger Ausf. B (Tiger II), the engine was coupled to a similar Maybach Olvar 40-20-16B <sup>gearbox(25.7)</sup>.


    In November 1942, the prototypes of the Porsche Tiger and the Henschel Tiger were evaluated against one another at Berka, in Thuringia. The Porsche vehicle was powered by two 10-cylinder, air-cooled, Porsche, petrol engines, built by Simmering-Graz-Pauker, while the Henschel vehicle was powered by the Maybach HL210. Both tanks were perceived to be under-powered and when asked, the Henschel team reported that they would soon receive the new “Maybach HL230 engine, of  750 metric hp_”<sup>(25.8)</sup>_. The expectations for this engine were, as often seemed to be the case in Germany and especially with Maybach, unrealistically high. The engine finally went into production with a rating of 700 PS (690 hp) at 3000 rpm but ended up producing much less in service. Incidentally, the testing at Berka also showed that the consumption figures presented by both Maybach and Porsche for their engines were grossly optimistic.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Note:</span> In the data section at the back of Jentz and Doyle’s book on the Tiger II, the output of the Maybach HL230 engine fitted in the Tiger Model B (Tiger II) is stated to be 750 hp at 3000 rpm. This is incorrect: all other sources, including Jentz and Doyle on their book on the Tiger Model E (Tiger I), state that the engine developed 700 metric hp at 3000 rpm. 


    Maybach did not keep separate records for the production of the HL210 and the HL230. The company produced 153 of the HL210/230 engines in 1942, 4346 in 1943, 2973 in 1944 and 987 in 1945. After a bombing raid in April 1944, production ceased and could only be restarted in October 1944. The engines were however also produced at other locations. Auto-Union, for instance, produced 4366 engines during 1944 and 1945. After producing about 800 engines per month in mid-1944, they were also bombed in September, reducing production to less than 300 engines per month during the following 2 months<sup>(25.9)</sup>. It is estimated that a total of about 9000 HL210 and HL230 engines were produced during the war.


    The rapid development, with inadequate testing, of the HL230, resulted in very poor reliability initially. Broken connecting rods, bearing failure, cylinder head gasket failures and a plethora of other problems were common. Spontaneous engine fires were also common, due to leaks in the fuel system, especially the fuel pumps. The lifespan of an engine was initially only 700-1000 km in the Panther.


    In November 1943, the governors of all HL230 engines were reset to limit RPM to a maximum of 2500 in an effort to increase reliability and longevity. This limited output to less than 600 hp. In the course of 1944, the engine  was further modified, including being fitted with an extra main bearing, new types of bearings, a new piston design and the compression ratio was lowered from 6.8:1 to 6.4:1, because of repeated head gasket failures, amongst other modifications.<sup> </sup>By the end of 1944, the HL230 engine’s reliability was approaching that of the other Maybach engines, like the HL120. The life-expectancy of the engines had doubled, to 1500-2000 kilometres, on average<sup>(25.10)</sup>.<sup> </sup>


    Many publications state that the engine produced “about 600 hp” at its reduced rate of 2500 rpm. It is interesting that von Heydekampf noted, in the final meeting of the Panzer Commission, in January 1945, that the engine only developed 540 hp at 2500 rpm<sup>(25.11)</sup>. In 1949, France started production of the somewhat anachronistic ARL 44 tank. This vehicle was also powered by the Maybach HL230 engine. According to this tank’s specifications, the engine developed 575 hp (presumably metric hp)<sup>(25.12)</sup>. These figures show that both the Panther and especially the Tiger were grossly under-powered and a far cry from the 750 hp initially projected by Maybach.

26. Maybach HL234: 

    Introduction:	1945 (prototype).	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	23 litres (1410 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 130x145 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		600-640 Kw (800-850 hp) at 3000 rpm. 


            34 – 37 hp/litre; 11.5-12.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1900-2040 N.m. (1400-1500 ft.lb) at 3000 rpm.


    BMEP: 		11.2 Bar (160 psi).


    Mps: 		14.5 m/s (48 ft/sec) at 3000 rpm.


    This was a fuel injected, improved, and strengthened version of the HL230, retaining the same bore, stroke and displacement. The carburettors were already recognised as a weak point of the HL230 in 1943 and development of a fuel injected version was started. As other problems with the engine appeared, improvements and modifications were designed into the new engine. It was strengthened all over, with improved connecting rods and rod bearing, modified main bearings, head gaskets, inlet and exhaust manifolds, improved cylinder head cooling, Belville washer type valve springs, etc. 


    The direct fuel injection increased maximum power and improved fuel consumption, especially at partial loading. The head gasket consisted of an iron ring combined with rubber rings instead of the copper rings used in the HL230. Repeated failures of the head gaskets was the main reason why the compression ratio of the Maybach HL230 engine had to be reduced from 6.8:1 to 6.4:1. Some of the problems encountered with the head gaskets were solved by incorporating solutions found in the British Meteor engine<sup>(26.1)</sup>. Cooling water flow paths were improved and the water pumps enlarged to help cope with the increased heat production of the more powerful engine. The HL230 was initially fitted with 7 main bearings. Early in 1944, an eighth bearing was added and in the HL234, another bearing was built in outside the flywheel so that the crankshaft ran in 9 main bearings<sup>(26.2)</sup>. 


    The engine was at an advanced stage of development by the end of the war. Production was intended to start by the middle of 1945. 


    During post-war interrogation, Von Heydekampf mentioned that the aim of the HL234 program was to improve the output of the HL230 engine from 650 PS to 800 PS, mainly through the introduction of fuel injection and increasing the compression ratio. Later, the output would be further increased to 900 PS by means of supercharging. In September 1944, Maybach sent a report to Wa Prüf 6 on the status of development of their tank engines. They also mentioned that they expected the HL234 to develop “at least” 800 metric hp at 3000 rpm. <sup>(26.3)</sup>.


    In a meeting of the Panzer Kommission (Entwicklungskommission Panzer), in January 1945, it was reported that the engine had achieved 900 PS (887 imperial hp; 660 Kw). This equates to almost 40 metric hp/litre and a BMEP of over 11.5 Bar. These are very high numbers, for an engine running on 74 octane petrol. During post-war interrogation of Dipl. Ing. Kniepkamp, he also referred to 900 PS being achieved, and Von Senger und Etterlin also mentions 900 PS normally aspirated, with 1100-1200 PS expected, with supercharging. In Potthoff & Schmid’s book on Wunibald Kamm, 660 Kw (885 hp) is mentioned as the output of the normally aspirated HL234. 


    Kamm’s firm, F.K.F.S., was involved with the development of the Sla-16 turbocharged diesel engine (see later). F.K.F.S. was apparently also developing a turbocharged version of the Maybach HL234, the HL234K, a prototype of which was nearing completion in 1945. This engine was expected to develop as much as 800 Kw (1075 hp)<sup>(26.4)</sup>. 


    Kniepkamp stated that an HL234 engine had been installed in a Tiger II tank, for trials, but that the installation of all ancillaries had not been completed before the end of the war<sup>(26.5)</sup>. 


    It is unclear if the 900 PS quoted by everybody for the normally aspirated version of the HL 234 was actually demonstrated, or was hearsay on the basis of claims by Prof. Maybach. Von Heydekampf felt that the engine could achieve 900 hp with conventional supercharging and, as mentioned, a turbocharged version was also being developed by F.K.F.S. Aside from the conventionally supercharged version, another supercharged version of the HL234 was however also planned which, according to Kniepkamp, was projected to have developed 1200 hp. The supercharger would not have been driven by the engine itself but would have been powered by a separate, 2-cylinder, supercharged engine, developing 70 hp. The small engine, a Maybach HL 10, two cylinder, four-stroke engine of 1.09 litre displacement, would have been mounted in the V of the V-12. It would have driven a large supercharger which would then supercharge both the small engine itself  as well as the main engine. The supercharger would therefore run at a constant speed, providing continuous, stable, high, manifold pressure, independent of the revolutions of the main engine<sup>(26.5)</sup>. 


    It is interesting to note that this principle was revived in the 1980s, with the French Leclerc MBT. This tank is fitted with the SACM VBX-1500 engine, consisting of a 16.5 litre, V-8 diesel, supercharged with a Turbomeca TM 307 gas turbine. The gas turbine functions as an auxiliary power unit as well as providing continuous supercharging to the diesel engine, regardless of the engine revolutions. This enables the engine to produce a maximum of 1500 hp at 2500 rpm, for a spectacular 90 hp/litre displacement and a BMEP of over 30 Bar! This was unheard of for a diesel engine in the mid-eighties when the Leclerc was developed. The MB 873 Ka-501 of the Leopard 2 tank, from the same era, also developes 1500 hp but this was generated by a conventionally turbocharged, 12 cylinder diesel of 47.6 litres<sup>(26.6)</sup>.


    It is notable how the performance expectations of Von Heydekampf and of Kniepkamp for the HL234 engine differed. Von Heydekampf obviously referred to conventional supercharging rather than the esoteric setup Kniepkamp referred to. At 900 hp, the BMEP of the unsupercharged HL234 would have been 11,85 Bar. If the supercharged version, as described by Kniepkamp, had materialised and if the performance had equalled expectations (1200 hp), the power to displacement ratio would have been 52 hp/l and the BMEP would have been 15.8 Bar.


    Taking everything into account, especially the performance of other, similar technology, petrol engines ( RR Meteor, the Continental AV 1790 and the Maybach HL 295), it is unlikely that the HL234 would have developed more than 800 to 850 PS at 3000 rpm, normally aspirated. With conventional supercharging, it would probably have produced about 900-950 hp. Kamm expected their turbocharged version to develop over 1000 hp and this sounds reasonable. Also see the notes on the Maybach HL 295.

    In September 1939, three prototypes of a 65 ton tank was ordered from Henschel (chassis) and Krupp (turret), the PzKpw VII (VK 65.01). The first of the prototypes would have been powered by a Maybach HL320 engine and the following two by even larger HL 360 petrol engines.<sup> </sup>In August 1940, the order for the VK 65.01 was cancelled. The one or two  completed prototype chassis were powered by HL224 engines. It is doubtful if an HL320 engine was ever completed<sup>(27.1)</sup>. 

28. Maybach HL295: 

    Introduction:	Post war (1945).	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	29.5 litres (1525 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 140x160 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline). Fuel injected.


            Power: 	640 Kw (860 hp) at 2800-3000 rpm. 28.8 hp/litre; 9.6 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		2190 N.m. (1620 ft.lb) at 2800 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.7 Bar (126 psi)


    Mps: 		16 m/s (53 fps) at 3000 rpm.


    This engine was a post-war development at the request of France. There possibly was a prototype of this engine present in the factory at the end of the war. A blueprint of the engine, dated September 1945, exists<sup>(28.1)</sup>. There was no mention of this engine in German WW2 notes however, for instance in the minutes of a meeting of the Panzer Commission, in January 1945. Friedrichshafen, where the main Maybach factory was located, lay in the French zone of occupation. The French started a tank development program after WW2 and in September 1946 they contracted Maybach to develop a 1000 hp engine for them. A few months later, a team of Maybach engineers (Gruppe M) transferred to Vernon, in France, where development of the engine started<sup>(28.2)</sup>.


    There is an example of the engine in the collection of the WTS museum, in Koblenz, in Germany<sup>(28.3)</sup>.


    The engine was used in prototypes of the post-war French AMX 50. It was a fuel injected unit, based on the HL234, and was expected to develop 900-1000 hp normally aspirated and up to 1200 hp with supercharging. Despite concerted efforts by the Maybach engineers, it apparently never produced more than about 860 hp however (29.1 hp/litre), and a supercharged version never materialised. Only 10-15 of these engines were built. The failure of this engine to achieve the projected performance is described as “an embarrassing  failure” by the Maybach engineers, according to some authors<sup>(28.4)</sup>.


    It should be noted however that the achieved performance conformed to that of other similar sized, petrol-fuelled, tank engines. The fuel-injected version of the Rolls Royce Meteor engine of 27 litre displacement developed 810 hp in the post-war Conqueror tank (30 hp/l). The Ford GAC, a V-12 derivative of the V-8 GAA/GAN/GAF engines, also displaced 27 litres but was fuelled by carburettors. It developed 770hp at its peak (28.5 hp/l), in the late 1940s. The post-war, fuel-injected, Continental AV-1790 engine of 29.3 litre displacement developed 810 hp (27.6 hp/l) in the M46, M47 and M48 tanks. One cannot but conclude that the projections for the big Maybach engine may have been unrealistic. The experience with this engine also makes the claim that the normally aspirated 23 litre Maybach HL234 achieved 900 PS, highly questionable.

29. Volswagen type 1: 

    Introduction:	1938


    Configuration: 	Flat four (boxer)


            Displacement: 	985 cc (60 c.i.). Later 1136 cc (69 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 70x64 and later 75x64.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		17 Kw (23 hp); later 18.6 Kw (25 hp), at 3300 rpm. 22.1 hp/litre.


    Torque:		54 N.m. (40 ft.lb) at 3300 rpm.


    BMEP: 		6.3 Bar (92 psi).


    Mps: 		7 m/s (23 fps) at 3300 rpm.


    This engine was used in the Type 62 and type 82  KdF Wagen (Volkswagen saloon car), the Type 82,  Kfz.1, “Kübelwagen” and the Type 166 Schwimmwagen. It initially displaced 986cc and developed 23.5 hp. In 1941, an enlarged, 1130 cc version, which produced 25 hp, was developed but it only became common in 1943<sup>(29.1)</sup>. 


    Notable are the bore and stroke of the engine; it is clearly over-square, with the bore larger than the stroke. At that time, this was unusual; most engines were under-square (stroke longer than the bore diameter). In an evaluation of an early model Kübelwagen, captured in the North-African desert, the engineering department of Humber Ltd., in the UK, noted that it is “a short stroke engine, the stroke-to-bore ratio being 0.91:1 compared to an average ratio of 1.45 to 1 in the UK and 1.25 to 1 in the US”. They found the compression ratio to be 5.2:1<sup>(29.2)</sup>.


    After the war, the VW factory was resurrected under Major Ivan Hirst of the British Army. Initially, the factory produced VW type 1 (Beetle) cars for the British Army but later similar cars were produced for civilian use. These cars were all initially powered by the 25 hp, 1131 cc engine introduced during the war<sup>(29.3)</sup>.

30. Opel Olympia:

    Introduction:	1935	


    Configuration: 	Inline four cylinder


    Displacement: 	1.5 litre (90 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 80x74 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		27 Kw (36 hp) at 3500 rpm. 24.2 hp/litre; 6.9 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		73 N.m. (54 ft.lb) at 3500 rpm.


    BMEP: 		6.5 Bar (94 psi).


    Mps: 		8.6 m/s (28 fps) at 3500 rpm.


    The Opel Olympia passenger car was introduced in 1935. It was initially powered by a 1.3 litre, 4-cylinder engine, developing 18 Kw (24 hp). Production ceased in 1940 but was resumed in 1947<sup>(30.1)</sup>. The Kettenrad used an enlarged, 36 hp version of the engine. When production of the Opel Olympia was resumed, in 1947, it also used this version of the engine.


    This engine was quite modern for the time, having two overhead valves per cylinder at a time when many engines were still flat head, side valve designs. It was used in the smallest of the German halftracks, the Sd. Kfz. 2 “Kettenrad”. The vehicle was designed and built by NSU Werke. Production started in 1940 and ceased in 1944, by which time some 8400 had seen the light. A small number was also built after the war for agricultural use. Production of the engine continued for several years after the war, for use in the Opel Olympia passenger car. The engine and drive-line components of the Kettenrad were also used in the Springer demolition vehicle<sup>(30.2)</sup>

31. Krupp M305: 

    Introduction:	1934	


    Configuration: 	Boxer (horizontally opposed) four cylinder.


    Displacement: 	3.5 litre (211 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 92x130 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		42 Kw (57 hp) at 2500 rpm. 16.5 hp/litre; 6.6 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		160 N.m. (120 ft.lb) at 2500 rpm.


    BMEP: 		5.9 Bar (86 psi).


    Mps: 		10.8 m/s (35,5 fps) at 3500 rpm.


    This small engine was used in the Pz Kpfw 1a tank, the Krupp Protze 6-wheeled truck and the Sd. Kfz. 247(Ausf.A)<sup>(31.1)</sup>. It was fed by two Solex downdraught carburettors, one for each bank, and it was cooled by a small fan. In the Pz Kpfw I, it was coupled to a ZF Aphon FG 35 gearbox. It soon proved to be too weak for the tank and in the Ausf. B variant, the 57 hp Krupp engine was replaced by the 90 hp. Maybach NL38 engine. The longer engine required the rear of the hull to be extended, with an extra bogie wheel in the suspension. This did increase the weight of the tank to 5.8 tons but despite this, the power-to-weight ratio was improved from just over 10 hp/ton to 15.5 hp/ton.<sup>(31.2)</sup>. 


    It is interesting to note that an effort was made to create a diesel powered version of the Pz Kpfw I by fitting it with an air-cooled, Krupp M 601 diesel engine. This engine developed only 45 hp at 2200 rpm which was grossly inadequate for the 5.4 ton vehicle and further development was discontinued<sup>(31.3)</sup>.

32. Steyr V-8:

    Introduction:	1934	


    Configuration: 	V-8


    Displacement: 	3.5 litres (215 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 78x92 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		64 Kw (85 hp) at 3300 rpm. 24.2 hp/litre; 7.3 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		160 N.m. (120 ft.lb) at 3300 rpm.


    BMEP: 		6.7 Bar (97 psi).


    Mps: 		11 m/s (36 fps) at 3300 rpm.


    This air-cooled, V-8, petrol engine was used in the Steyr 1500A truck as well as in the majority of Raupenschlepper Ost vehicles. It was designed by Ferdinand Porsche who had joined Steyr in 1929 and worked there for several years<sup>(32.1)</sup>. The engine had two large centrifugal fans mounted on top and driven by a V-belt from an engine pulley.

    An interesting side-note is that this Steyr engine, in highly modified form, was used by Sydney Allard, a well-known British race driver, in several successful racing cars during the post-war years<sup>(32.2)</sup>.

33. Porsche 100 and 101: 

    Introduction:	1941	


    Configuration: 	V10


            Displacement: 	Typ 100: 10 litres (610 c.i.). Typ 101: 15 litres (919 c.i.). 


            Bore and stroke (Typ 101):115x145 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


            Power: 	Typ 101: 240 Kw (320 hp) at 2400 rpm. 21.3 hp/litre; 


            8.9 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		950 N.m. (700 ft.lb) at 2400 rpm.


    BMEP: 		7.9 Bar (115 psi).


    Mps: 		11.6 m/s (38 fps) at 2400 rpm.


    For an extensive description of the development and demise of these engines, Fröhlisch’s book: Der Andere Tiger (The Other Tiger) may be consulted (German language)<sup>(33.1)</sup>.


    On March 1, 1941, 6 prototypes of the Porsche Type 100 tank were ordered. This was Porsche’s entry for a tank of 30-35 tons (VK 30.01(P)). The mechanical lay-out of the vehicle was highly unusual. It was to be powered by two engines, driving two generators which in turn powered two electric motors, one for the left track and one for the right track. Steering was accomplished by varying the power to the two electric motors. 


    Prof. Ferdinand Porsche believed that conventional, mechanical transmissions would not be able to efficiently and reliably power very large and heavy armoured vehicles and that electric or hydraulic drive would be more effective. For the prototypes of his tank, he envisaged several drive line variants, with either electric or hydraulic drives, and various engines, in order to obtain the most powerful and/or efficient performance possible<sup>(33.2)</sup>. He had had considerable experience with electrical vehicles as well as hybrid petrol-electric vehicles, through the Egger-Lohner electric carriage produced in 1901 and a later hybrid version of this vehicle. This was the first petroleum-electric hybrid vehicle on record<sup>(33.3)</sup>.


    Electric drive has theoretical advantages for the propulsion of large, heavy vehicles and more countries have experimented with its use in tanks, notably the US. During the development of what was to become the T26 and finally the M26 Pershing tank, the T23 was built. This was powered by a Ford GAN engine which drove a generator which in turn powered an electric traction motor at each final drive. Such an electric drive provides immense torque at low speed, and the speed of the respective motors can be varied so that an infinite gear range and steering radii are possible, without the use of complex, mechanical steering gear. Total production of the T23 was 250 vehicles<sup>(33.4)</sup>.


    The engines for the Porsche prototype vehicles were also designed by Porsche but the Typ 100 engines were built by Steyr, in Austria, and the later Typ 101 by Simmering-Graz-Pauker, also in Austria. The Typ 100 engines displaced 10 litres, developed 210 PS at 2500 rpm and consumed petrol at 270 g/PS/litre at 2500 rpm. One engine weighed 420 kg but the cooling system (fans and drive system) added 130 kg<sup>(33.5)</sup>. The first engine was delivered to Stuttgard on July 7, 1941 for trials on a test bench. Trials revealed many problems, especially with oil foaming and lubrication.


    Two prototypes of the Type 100 tanks, without turrets, were delivered in February and March 1942 for testing. By that time, the decision had already been taken to develop a heavier version of the tank, mainly because it was to be armed with an 88 mm gun instead of the 75mm squeeze bore (Gerlich principle) gun originally envisaged, and the bigger gun required a bigger turret with a larger turret ring diameter. The bigger gun was specified as the Germans had had numerous contacts with Russian T34 and KV tanks since July of the previous year, and they came to the conclusion that a more heavily armoured and armed tank was needed.


    At the “3<sup>rd</sup>  great tank meeting” (dritte große Panzerkonferenz), in November 1941, Hitler expressed his concern that the tanks being developed in Germany at that time, including the various VK 30.01 models, would not be adequate against the new generation Russian and British tanks. He suggested that 3 types of tank should be developed: a light type similar in weight to the Pz. Kpfw. III, a medium type similar to the Pz. Kpfw. IV, and a heavy type, heavier than the planned VK 30.01. Prototypes were to be developed by Porsche and Henschel. Porsche was also instructed to look at the possibility of a super-heavy tank. This would later become the Maus<sup>(33.6)</sup>.


    The Porsche type 100 tank, which was to be about 35 tons, was therefore redesigned  to a 45 ton tank, the type 101. This was to be Porsche’s suggestion for the Tiger I and it finally crystalized as a vehicle weighing well over 50 tons. For this vehicle, the Type 100 engine was clearly not powerful enough and a new engine was designed, the type 101. The type 101 engine was basically just an enlarged version of the type 100. It was a 72° V10, with a bore and stroke of 115x140 mm, for a displacement of 15 litres. In the centre of the V nestled two Solex 50 JFF 2, twin throat carburettors. The compression ratio was only 5,6:1. It ran for the first time in January 1942. The engine produced 310-320 hp at 2400 rpm and weighed between 420-450 kg. Each engine was coupled to a Siemens 275 kilowatt generator which drove one of the tracks<sup>(33.7)</sup>. 


    At the same time, the possibility of a diesel-fuelled version of the Type 101 engine was investigated. Two single cylinder trial engines, with a cylinder displacement of 1,5 litres (like the type 101), were built. One was direct injection and the other indirect injection (pre-chamber injection). It is interesting to note that Ferry Porsche also visited the Daimler Benz company in search of a possible diesel engine for the Type 101 tank at this time<sup>(33.8)</sup>.


    The designation Typ 101 for the tank was changed by Porsche to Typ 180, in October 1941<sup>(33.9)</sup>.


    The Type 101 series engines went through various versions, i.e 101/2, 101/3, 101/4, etc. Porsche actually intended to produce a number of variants of the Porsche Tiger: the Typ 180A and 180B were variants driven by Porsche Typ 101 petrol engines and electric drives; the Typ 181A was to be powered by Porsche Typ 101/4 petrol engines and Voith hydraulic drives; the Typ 181B was to be driven by two Porsche-Deutz Typ 180/1, 16 cylinder diesel engines, each with a displacement of 19.6 litres, generating 370 PS at 2000 rpm; the Typ 181C was to be driven by a  Typ 180/2, 16 cylinder diesel developing 700 PS<sup>(33.10)</sup>.


    Nothing more is known of the intended 16 cylinder Porsche-Deutz diesel engines. The 16 cylinder “Typ 180/2” engine is actually the Sla-16 engine developed by Simmering-Graz-Pauker and which was almost production ready at the end of the war. This is discussed later.


    A single prototype was also apparently completed of a Porsche Typ 102 Fahrgestell. This was similar to the Typ 101 but instead of electric generators and motors, the engines drove Voith Hydraulic pumps and hydraulic motors to drive the tracks. Little is known about this vehicle or the test results<sup>(33.10)</sup>.


    There were a lot of problems with the Typ 101 engines because of insufficient development. The engines over-heated, leaked oil and guzzled fuel. They would leak oil, the oil would progressively cover the cooling fins of the cylinders, which caused the engine to run hotter, which in turn caused further thinning of the oil and increased oil leakage. During the Berka comparative trials, in November 1942, the Henschel Tiger with one Maybach HL210 engine used an average of 884 litres of petrol per 100km. The Porsche prototype, with two 101/2 engines fitted, used 1707 litres/100 km!<sup>(33.11)</sup>. Incidentally, the cooling fans of the water-cooled Maybach HL210 in the Henschel tank absorbed about 55 PS. The cooling fans of the Typ 101 engines initially used about 45 hp but this was improved to 35 hp in later models, i.e. 70 hp for the two engines together.


    The end of the development of these engines illustrates the chaotic nature of tank development in Germany during WW2. In February 1943, Porsche decided that future models of the Porsche Tiger would be powered by the new Sla-16 air-cooled diesel engine, also developed and built by Simmering-Graz-Pauker. Because of the order for Sla-16 engines, S-G-P destroyed the already produced parts for the 10 cylinder petrol engines. It then turned out that the diesel engine was not yet ready for production, and S-G-P was not prepared to restart building the petrol engines anew. Porsche then switched to water-cooled Maybach HL120 engines for following prototypes<sup>(33.12)</sup>. 


    In the long run, the engine choice did not matter, as the Henschel vehicle became the preferred choice. Ninety of the 100 produced Porsche hulls were completed as Ferdinand Panzerjäger, three were converted to Bergepanzer recovery vehicles, three were completed with Rammtiger superstructures, and four vehicles were fitted with turrets, as complete Porsche Tigers, and retained for further tests<sup>(33.13)</sup>.

    BMEP: 		About 6.5 Bar (94 psi) for all versions.


    Mps: 		10-12.7 m/s (33 to 42 fps) at maximum rpm. 


    The TNHP-S tank entered Czechoslavakian service in 1938. It was produced by the large ČKD engineering concern and was at that time regarded as one of the most modern tanks in the world. Production of these vehicles was therefore continued after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and the ČKD works was renamed the Böhmisch-Märische Machinenfabrik AG (BMM). 


    On the first of July, just after the start of Operation Barbarossa, the Wehrmacht had 763 of these tanks in service, as the Pz. Kpfw. 38(t). Soon after the invasion of Russia, it became clear that the 10 ton tank with its 37mm gun was obsolescent. Production of the chassis continued however and the vehicle formed the basis of a number of self-propelled guns and tank-destroyers.


    These overhead valve engines were used in various versions of the Pz Kpfw 38(t) tank and its derivatives. Compression ratio was 6.2:1<sup>(34.1)</sup>. Increased power was mainly achieved by allowing the engines to run at higher rpm.

    This engine powered the PzKpfw 38(t) “neuer Art” reconnaissance tank. The exact genesis of this tank is not quite clear, but it was intended as a fast reconnaissance tank, of about 10 tons. It had the same role therefore as the Pz. Kpfw. II Luchs and the Skoda T15 tank<sup>(35.1)</sup>. Reportedly, 15 prototypes were produced in 1942, but no production followed<sup>(35.2)</sup>.

    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		90 Kw (120 hp) at 1800 rpm. 14.1 hp/litre; 7.8 hp.litre/1000 rpm.

    BMEP: 		7.0 Bar (102 psi).


    This engine powered the Pz. Kpfw 35(t). 


    The Czech LTM 35 tank was in wide use with the Czech army at the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, in March 1939. The tanks had also been widely exported before the war. It was regarded as a very modern and reliable tank in the late thirties. Combat weight was around 10.5 ton. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Czech tanks were taken into service by the Germans, as the Pz. Kpfw. 35(t), although production was not continued. 


    The tanks were used during the invasion of Poland and France, and during the early phases of the campaign is Russia. By June 1942, the German army still had 167 of the vehicles in service but they were clearly obsolescent by this time. The dwindling number of tanks available could only be maintained by cannibalizing other Pz. Kpfw. 35(t)s, and after 1942 they were not used operationally by the Germans. The remaining vehicles were sometimes used as artillery tractors after being retired as tanks<sup>(36.1)</sup>.

    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		175 Kw (235 hp) at 2800 rpm. 21.7 hp/litre; 7.75 hp/litre/1000 rpm.

    BMEP: 		6.9 Bar (100 psi).


    Mps:		12.1 m/s (40 fps).


    This engine was intended for the Pz.Sp.Wg. II (Ausf. Skoda), or Skoda T-15. In September 1939, the Heereswaffenamt issued a request for a fast reconnaissance tank, better armoured and armed than the Pz. Kpfw. II, to MAN and to Skoda. Four prototypes were built up to 1945, but no production resulted<sup>(37.1)</sup>.


    At least one of the prototypes was trialled at Kümmersdorf in the spring of 1942. It was tested over 4000 km, mostly off-road, and it was noted that the cylinders and main bearings were worn out and had to be replaced at 3900 km<sup>(37.2)</sup>.


    The Skoda Works in Pilsen also designed another vehicle for the HWA, under the designation “T 25”. It was to be a 25 ton tank armed with a 75mm high velocity gun, sloped armour and powered by an air-cooled, 450 hp engine. Armour thickness varied from 10 to 30 mm. This remained a paper project and no prototype or engine was built.

38. Büssing-NAG L8V: 

    Introduction:	1935/1938	


    Configuration: 	V-8


            Displacement: 	7.9 litres (483 c.i.) and 8.4 litres (510 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 102x121 and 102x128 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


            Power: 	112 Kw (150 hp) at 2700 rpm and 135 Kw (180 hp) at 3000 rpm respectively. 18.9 and 21.5 hp/litre respectively.


            Torque:	380 N.m. (280 ft.lb) and 430 N.m. (320 ft.lb) at 2700/3000 rpm respectively.


    BMEP: 		6.4 Bar (93 psi).


    Mps:		11.3 m/s (37 fps) and 12.8 m/s (42 fps) respectively.


    This engine originally displaced 7.9 litres and developed 150 hp at 2700 rpm. A later version of the engine displaced 8.36 litres and developed 180 hp at 3000 rpm. They were used in some of the Sd. Kfz. 231 armoured cars, as well as in the Sd. Kfz. 232, 233 and 263 cars.

    The Büssing engine was also used in the production version of the “15cm. sIG 33 auf Fahrgestell Pz. Kpfw..II”. Twelve of these self-propelled guns, based on the Pz. Kpfw. II, were built in 1941/2. The prototype used the standard 140 hp, Maybach HL62 engine of the Pz. Kpfw. II, but the production vehicles were larger (longer and wider) than the tank and incorporated an extra road-wheel. They were also heavier than the Pz. Kpfw. II and were therefore powered by the more powerful Büssing 180 hp engine. The engine was reportedly installed transversely in the engine compartment, to save space, but it is not clear how this was done and what type of right-angle transfer case was employed to get the power to the front-mounted gearbox<sup>(38.1)</sup>. 


    During use in North Africa, these attractive vehicles unfortunately turned out to be very unreliable. The chassis and power-train proved to be over-loaded, with drive-shaft breakages, and transmission and suspension failures being common. Over-heating was an especially severe problem and they are usually seen with the engine hatches open to assist with cooling<sup>(38.2)</sup>.<sup>     </sup>

    In 1935/6, the firm, Eisenwerk Wesenhütte AG, in Bad Oeynhausen, developed a new range of small, 4x4 armoured cars, to be used for reconnaissance purposes. These excellent vehicles were introduced in 1937, in a number of versions. They were all powered by a V-8, Horch engine<sup>(39.1)</sup>. This 3.5 litre, side-valve engine was introduced in 1935. It powered the Sd. Kfz. 221, early Sd. Kfz. 222, Sd. Kfz.247(b) and the Sd. Kfz. 260.<sup> </sup>An enlarged version of the engine (3.823 litres), which developed 85-90 hp, was introduced in 1938. It was used to power later versions of the Sd. Kfz. 222, 223, 261, and Mannsch. Kw. (Kfs 70)<sup>(39.2)</sup>.

    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline)


    Power: 		745 Kw (1000 hp) at 2050 rpm. 20.8 hp/litre; 10,1 hp/litre/1000 rpm.

    F.K.F.S. (Forschungsinstitut für Kraftfahrwesen und Fahrzeugmotoren Stuttgard) was founded in 1930 by engineer Wunibald Kamm. He designed and built prototypes of a number of multibank, air-cooled aircraft engines. The “Gruppen-Flugmotor D” , a 48 cylinder (8 banks of 6 cylinders each), air-cooled, aircraft engine was built in 1944 and was forecast to develop almost 6000 horsepower. F.K.F.S. was also involved in the efforts to develop more powerful engines for the Panther, Tiger II and the Maus. Kamm designed a tank engine which was basically half a Flugmotor D, i.e., 4 banks of 6 cylinders each, without supercharging. This engine was envisaged to develop about 810 Kw (1080 hp) but it remained a paper exercise<sup>(40.1)</sup>.


    The company was also involved in the development of the Sla X-16 engine which was being developed by Simmering-Graz-Pauker, in Austria. Kamm’s firm was responsible for the design and manufacture of the cooling system for the X-16 engine. Kamm envisaged a diesel powered engine of the same “double V-12” as his aircraft engines, design, using the pistons, sleeves and heads of the Sla X-16 engine. This would have resulted in a monster of almost 55 litres displacement, which, with turbocharging, would probably have produced about 1200-1300 hp. Nothing more than drawings came of this however<sup>(40.2)</sup>.


    F.K.F.S. was also busy designing a turbocharged version of the Maybach HL234 engine by the end of the war. As far as known, this engine never ran but it was envisaged to produce over 1000 hp.

41. Deutz F4L514:

    BMEP: 		5.2 Bar (75 psi).


    Mps:		9.8 m/s (32 fps) at 2100 rpm.


    This air-cooled diesel engine went into production in 1942 and was installed in a small number (674) of Raupenschlepper Ost vehicles. Production of the engine continued after the war for commercial purposes, amongst others to power the “Waldschlepper”, a post-war, halftrack adaptation of the Raupenschlepper, intended for agricultural purposes. Deutz built 1460 of these vehicles in 1946/7. 


    The lay-out of the engine is virtually identical to that of the Deutz air-cooled industrial engines still being produced today.


    Air-cooling was regarded as especially desirable under the freezing conditions often encountered on the Eastern front, although starting diesel engines under these conditions could be difficult<sup>(41.1)</sup>.

42. Tatra 103: 

    Introduction:	1941	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	14.8 litres (905 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 110x130 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air


    Fuel:		Diesel


    Power: 		165 Kw (220 hp) at 2250 rpm. 15 hp/litre; 6.6 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		670 N.m. (500 ft.lb.) at 2250 rpm.


    BMEP: 		5.9 Bar (86 psi). 


    Mps:		9.8 m/s (32 fps) at 2250 rpm.


    Although the 8-wheeled “Einheitswagens” (Sd. Kfz. 231, 232 and 233) armoured cars were still in full production at that time, the HWA received an order to develop a new, modernised, 8-wheeled armoured car, utilising a monocoque chassis/hull, in August 1940. The African campaign was in full swing and the new armoured car was intended for use in tropical climates. For this reason, the Czecho-Slovakian firm of Tatra received an order for the development of a 220 hp air-cooled diesel engine. The car was developed by Büssing NAG and the turret by Daimler-Benz. The first prototype was delivered in July 1942 and after further improvements, the Sd. Kfz. 234 went into production a year later<sup>(42.1)</sup>.


    This air-cooled, 75°, V-12, diesel engine was an excellent unit, by all accounts. It was used in the various variants of the Sd. Kfz. 234 8-wheeled armoured car and was intended to power later versions of the Pz Kpfw 38(t) based vehicles. It was apparently also used in some examples of the Sd. Kfz. 9,  heavy halftrack. This vehicle was mainly built by the FAMO and Vomag companies, and it was usually powered by the Maybach HL108 or HL120 engine. It was however also built by the Tatra company, under licence, and some of the latter’s vehicles were fitted with their air-cooled diesel engine. The engine was built for many years post-war as a truck engine (Tatra 111 truck)<sup>(42.2)</sup>.


    As a follow-up model to the Sd. Kfz. 221/222/223, the Heereswaffenamt ordered a light armoured car which would use as many of the components of the Sd.Kfz 234 as possible, in 1941. Frontal armour was to be 30mm, and the overall weight, 7 tons. Two prototypes of this vehicle were built by Büssing-NAG early in 1943. After successful tests, production was planned for late in 1943 but nothing came of this. This car, the Leichter Panzerspähwagen Tp4, was powered by a 6-cylinder Tatra air-cooled diesel engine of 125 hp. Nothing else is known of this engine. It was possibly “half” of the V-12 Tatra 103 engine, i.e. an inline, six-cylinder, air-cooled unit of about 7.4 litres<sup>(42.3)</sup>.

43. Daimler-Benz (Mercedes) engines:

    The history and details of the various large Mercedes engines intended for armoured vehicle use during WW2 are somewhat murky, to say the least. Most of their potential tank engines were derived from their 12-cylinder aircraft engines. Some remained petrol fuelled but were adapted to the lower octane value of petrol used by the land forces, while others were diesel versions. The aircraft engines were all inverted V designs while the tank derivatives were upright engines, i.e, with the cylinder heads at the top. 


    Some of the confusion around the large Daimler Benz engines may stem from the fact that the company also developed and built large diesel engines for airships, and for marine use. In the early thirties, the F-2 engine was built, a petrol V-12 of 54 litres intended for aviation use. It was never used in aircraft but apparently did see some service in a few fast motor boats. A diesel version of this engine, the ÖF-2 (Ö = Ölmotor = “oil engine”) was built for use in airships. From this was developed a much larger diesel engine, the V-16 DB 602 of 88 litre displacement which provided 900 hp at 1480 rpm to power the Hindenburg and the Graf Zeppelin II<sup>(43.1)</sup>. 


    From these large airship engines, Daimler-Benz developed marine diesels for use in fast patrol boats and torpedo boats. The marine engines were part of the MB 500 series of engines. The MB 500 was a 4-stroke, V12 engine with the same bore and stroke as the DB 602, and it developed a maximum of 900 hp at 1630 rpm and 700 hp at 1460 rpm continuous. A later version of the marine engine, the MB 501, was a V20, but it differed from the MB 500 in many ways, i.e. bore and stroke (185 x 250), angle between the banks (40° versus 60°), etc. The MB 502 was a V-16 which reverted to the bore and stroke of the original MB 602 engine. These engines are however not the subject of this dissertation<sup>(43.2)</sup>. 


    The following liquid-cooled, upright, V-12 engines were intended for possible combat vehicles use:

    As mentioned previously, the first discussions with Prof. Maybach about a 600 hp engine for a 30 ton tank took place in 1935<sup>(9)</sup>. At the same time, in October 1935, a technical discussion with Daimler-Benz engineers and managers took place at the Heereswaffenamt. The subject of the discussion was the possibility of utilising the M 71 aircraft engine, later known as the DB 600, as a tank engine. 


    This aircraft engine ran for the first time in 1932. It was fed by a carburettor and in 1935 it was replaced by the DB 601; basically the same engine but fitted with fuel injection. For aircraft use the DB 600 was supercharged and, depending on version, it developed between 850 and 1050 PS.  Normally aspirated and carburettor fed, as a tank engine, it developed a maximum of 600 PS at 2200 rpm, and it could deliver 550 PS continuously at around 2000 rpm. It was also envisaged at that time that petrol fuel injection and even conversion to diesel fuel would be addressed in future. The petrol model for tank use would be known as the MB 503 while a diesel version would be designated the MB 507.


    On the 3<sup>rd</sup> of June 1937, Wa Prüf 6 ordered two MB 503 engines from Daimler-Benz. They were to be rated at 700-800 PS maximum power. The engines were delivered in the spring of 1938, for testing<sup>(43.3)</sup>. The 700-800 hp specification is interesting. It is substantially greater than the maximum of 600 PS at 2200 presented in 1935. As mentioned, the carburetted DB 600 aircraft engine was replaced by the fuel injected DB 601, of the same displacement, in 1935. The engines requested in 1937 may have been fuel injected versions, but this is pure speculation.


    In February 1942, during the development of what would become the Panther, it was decided that Daimler Benz would complete 5 prototypes of their suggestion for the VK 30.01. One would have an MB 503 petrol engine, one an MB 507 diesel engine and three would be powered by Maybach HL210 engines. In the end, it was decided that only the M.A.N. VK 30.02 would be produced and this finally evolved into the Panther. The MB 503 engine did eventually power a few examples of the Karl-Gerät, a large siege mortar<sup>(43.4)</sup>. 


    It is interesting to compare the specifications for the MB 503 petrol engine, the MB 507 diesel, and the Maybach HL230 petrol unit, the 3 engines that were considered for powering the Panther. Both the original power specification for the MB 503 (600 hp) and the 1937 specification (750 hp) are calculated. It should be noted that the MB 507 diesel variant had grown to 42.5 litres by 1942.


    			<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cm<sup>3</sup>	   Power     	    Torque	  hp/litre     mps	  BMEP</span>


    HL230:		23098   700 PS (3000)    1660 N.m.	     30.4      14.5 m/s     9.1 Bar


    MB 503 (1935)	33933	 600 PS (2200)     1940 N.m.      17.6      12.8 m/s     6.6 Bar


    MB 503 (1937)	33933	 750 PS (2200)     2430 N.m.	     22.1      12.8 m/s     9.0 Bar

    The torque figures stated here are calculated at maximum rpm for the engines, i.e. 3000 rpm for the HL 230, 2200 for the two Mercedes petrol engines and 2000 for the diesel MB 507. 


    Maximum torque actually occurred at lower RPM and exceeded the torque developed at maximum RPM<sup>(43.5)</sup>.


    				Max. torque rpm.	Max. torque value	Engine volume


    Maybach HL230:			2250		1775 N.m.		1.56 m<sup>2</sup>


    MB 503 gasoline (1935):		1450		1950 N.m.		n.a.


    MB 507 diesel:			1300		2450 N.m.		1.82 m<sup>2</sup>


    The increased volume of the MB 507 compared to the Maybach engine was almost entirely due to its longer length: more than 1.8 metres compared to 1.3 metres for the Maybach.


    Most noticeable here is that the Maybach engine is more efficient than the Mercedes engines (hp/litre) but that the torque figures for the MB engines, especially the diesel, are significantly higher than the those of the Maybach unit. There can be little doubt that the fragile final drives of the Panther would never have coped with the more powerful MB engines.

44. MB 509: 

    Introduction:	1942/3	


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	44.5 litres (2716 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 162x180 mm 


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid.


    Fuel:		Petrol (gasoline). Fuel injected.


            Power: 	900 Kw (1200 hp) at 2400 rpm. 27 hp/litre; 11,25 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		3560 N.m. (2640 ft.lb) at 2400 rpm.


    BMEP: 		10 Bar (145 psi). 


    Mps:		14.4 m/s (47 fps) at 2400 rpm.


    The MB 509 engine was a tank version of the petrol, DB 603, aircraft engine. It had a greater displacement than the MB 503, and it featured direct fuel injection. Production of the DB 603 aircraft engine started in May 1942. The MB 509 developed about 1350 hp with 87 octane petrol and around 1200 hp with 74 octane, army fuel. It was used in at least one of the only 2 prototypes of the Maus super heavy tank chassis to be built. One of the prototypes was possibly powered by an MB 507 diesel engine. 


    On June 8, 1942, Hitler instructed Prof. Porsche to develop a super heavy tank. A model was shown to Hitler in January 1943 and, after some delay, the Alkett company started construction of a prototype in August 1943. The first prototype chassis ran for the first time in December 1943. A second prototype was built in the first half of 1944 and both were then tested at the Kummersdorf testing area. These were finally blown up to prevent capture by the Red Army, in 1945. Some unfinished hulls and turrets of the initial order of 10 vehicles, remained at Krupp’s Meppen testing area. Apparently, 200 engines were ordered for the Maus, but this did not go through after development and production of the Maus was derailed by Allied air attacks, and finally cancelled<sup>(44.1)</sup>. 


    In the Maus, a two cylinder, two-stroke engine of 8 hp served as starter for the main engine. It was used to spin up a flywheel and the inertia of this was used to turn over the large main engine. Another two cylinder, two-stroke engine served as an auxillary generator, to power ventilation, and for heating the fighting compartment. The cooling fans for the water-cooled main engine used about 150 PS. The engine drove two generators, fitted in tandem, which in turn drove the electric motors for the left and right tracks respectively<sup>(44.2)</sup>.

    Originally, it was decided that a diesel version of the MB 503 petrol engine would carry the designation  MB 507<sup>(43.2)</sup>. The MB 503 was a V-12 of 34 litre displacement. However, according to all sources, the MB 507, as it was offered for powering the Panther, had a much greater displacement, i.e. 42.35 litres or 44.5 litres. It is usually stated that the MB 507 was a diesel version of the DB 603 aircraft engine (bore and stroke 162x180 mm). The DB 603 however only went into production in May 1942 while Daimler-Benz already had a MB 507 engine on offer, for their version of the VK 30.02, in February 1942. It is not clear what the specifications were of this engine. 


    The MB 507 engine was an upright, normally aspirated, 60 degree V-12 with overhead valves. Further details of the engine are muddled. In Spielberger’s book on the Panther, and in “Die Deutsche Panzer” (Von Senger und Etterlin), it is stated that the bore and stroke were 158x180 mm (42.3 litres) and the compression ratio was 17:1. Maximum power was stated to be 850 hp at 2300 rpm with maximum continuous power being 700 at 2000 rpm. The aluminium engine supposedly weighed in at a very modest 850kg<sup>(45.1)</sup>.


    In the same book by Spielberger however, a table is presented comparing the details of the various proposals for the VK 30.02, i.e. those by Daimler Benz and by MAN. Here it is stated that the MB 507 had a bore and stroke of 162x180 (44.5 litres), i.e. identical to the MB 603, that the compression ratio was 14,8:1 and that the maximum output was 650 hp at 2000 rpm<sup>(45.2)</sup>. The engine drove a Daimler Benz KGS 8-200 gearbox. These data were apparently taken from the Daimler-Benz archives.


    Initially, it was decided that Daimler-Benz would produce five prototypes of the VK 30.02 (DB). One powered by a MB 503 petrol engine, one by a MB 507 diesel and three powered by Maybach HL210 engines. In March 1942 Hitler actually ordered the VK 30.02 (DB) into production, but after reviewing the proposals by MAN and DB, in May 1942, the Panzerkommission decided that the MAN proposal was more suitable for production, and Hitler concurred<sup>(45.3)</sup>.


    The MAN prototype was basically selected because the turret which DB was designing for their tank, was not production ready yet. Rheinmetall had designed the turret for the MAN VK 30.02 prototype and it was production ready. Because the DB vehicle had a smaller turret ring than the MAN vehicle, the Rheinmetall turret could not be fitted to the DB vehicle. Finally, the complicated interleaved wheel suspension of the MAN was regarded as superior to the simple, leaf spring suspension of the DB vehicle.


    Von Senger und Etterlin suggests that prototypes of the VK 30.01(DB) were actually built and tested, with the MB 507 diesel<sup>(45.4)</sup>. Daimler Benz later proposed again that the engine could be used in the production versions of the Panther (MAN) and/or Tiger (Henschel), when the problems with the Maybach HL230 in these tanks became evident. The MB 507 engine was however substantially larger than the Maybach HL230 and would have required extensive modifications to the hull of the Panther or Tiger tank, including lengthening it<sup>(45.5)</sup>. 


    In the data table, the details of both versions of the engine are presented. The claimed maximum power output of 850 PS from a 42 litre, naturally aspirated diesel engine from this era seems very high, at over 20 hp/litre, or 8,4 PS/litre/1000 rpm, and a BMEP of 7.4 Bar. Fifteen years later, the naturally aspirated MB 837 engine which was installed in the German Jagdpanzer vehicles, only achieved about 17 hp/litre, or 7,7 PS/litre/1000 rpm, and a BMEP of 6,9 Bar<sup>(45.6)</sup>. It is more likely that the output of the MB 507 engine would have been in the order of 650 PS at 2000 rpm, with a sustained power output of around 580-600 PS at 1800-1900 rpm.


    The stated weight of the MB 507 (850 kg) for this 42 litre, V-12 diesel, is in itself questionable. Compression ignition engines (diesel) are higher stressed than spark ignition (petrol) engines. Diesels are therefore generally significantly heavier and more robust than petrol engines. Yet, the diesel MB 507 of 42 litre displacement supposedly weighed approximately the same as the 21 litre Maybach HL210, petrol engine, also constructed mainly of aluminium. One cannot but wonder about the durability of such a light-weight diesel engine, if the data are correct.


    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span> The stated weight of a given engine is often problematical. It is usually unclear if the stated weight is of the bare engine, or with ancillaries like exhaust and intake manifolds, generator, hydraulic pump, possible cooling shrouds, etc. attached. It may even be the weight of the powerpack, i.e. with transmission attached. The MB 507 is stated to have weighed 850 kg while the MB 837, built during the sixties and also consisting mainly of aluminium castings, weighed 1450 kg (see later). This is presumably because the 507’s weight was for the naked “short block” while the 837’s weight included all manner of ancillaries and various added on bits and pieces.


    The MB 507c version of the engine was used to power a few examples of the Karl Gerät, a large siege mortar. In this application, it produced 580 hp at 1850 rpm<sup>(43.2)</sup>. This output conforms to what one would expect from this engine.


    Some sources claim that the MB 507c developed 1000 hp at 2400 rpm and 750 at 1950 rpm <sup>(45.7)</sup>. This is simply incorrect. A normally aspirated diesel from that era would never have been able to achieve this kind of power output (22.5 hp/litre). This figure may have referred to a projected supercharged version of the engine, although even higher performance was claimed for that version of the engine.

    The MB 517 was supposedly a supercharged MB 507, intended for the Maus<sup>(46.1)</sup>. According to Spielberger’s book on the Panther and its variants, the engine developed 1250 horsepower<sup>(46.2)</sup>. This equals 28 hp/litre, and a BMEP of more than 10 Bar. This is nonsense. No four-stroke diesel engine from the WW2 era could produce over 28 hp/l and a BMEP of 10,5 Bar, with or without turbocharging or supercharging. The contemporary, state-of-the-art, turbocharged, Sla-16 diesel engine is well-documented to have produced less than 22 hp/l. Russia built an experimental, supercharged, version of the V-2 tank diesel engine used in the T34 and the KV tanks, by fitting it with an aircraft supercharger. This also developed about 22 hp/litre<sup>(61.1)</sup>. 


    Diesel tank engines with outputs in the range of 30 hp/l only became available with the Leopard 2 tank, in the 1970s, 30 years after WW2. It is likely that the MB 517 would probably have produced about 900 hp at around 2000 rpm. That equals a BMEP of 9 Bar. The turbocharged, intercooled MB 873 Ka 501 of the Leopard 2 develops 1500 hp from a capacity of 47.6 litres, at 2600 rpm. This is just over 31 hp/l, for a BMEP of 10.7<sup>(46.3)</sup>.

    Wa Prüf 6 issued design guidelines for the development of diesel engines for tanks in December 1938<sup>(47.1)</sup>. At this time, Daimler Benz was already heavily involved in the development of diesel tank engines. An internal memo from Mercedes, dated May 1938, at their Marienfelde plant, noted that Daimler-Benz AG was to develop a new 20 ton tank and that a 400 hp engine would be required for this vehicle. Wa Prüf 6 of the HWA had suggested the Maybach HL190 petrol engine but MB felt that they could design and build a diesel engine which could compete with the Maybach unit. Development of such an engine had started at MB in June 1938.


    According to Von Senger und Etterling, Mercedes had four diesel engine projects by December 1938. These were all V-12, four-stroke engines<sup>(47.2)</sup>:

* A 25.5 litre unit developing 400 PS at 2100 rpm.
* A 21.5 litre unit developing 300 PS at 2200 rpm.
* A 19.7 litre unit developing 400 PS at 2400 rpm.
* A 14.8 litre unit developing 300 PS at 2400 rpm.

    As mentioned previously, diesel engines at that time were large and heavy beasts. To compete with a petrol engine of similar power, a diesel would have had to be both exceptionally light and compact. The issue really was if the diesel could compete with the petrol engine as far as the volume and weight of the whole power-pack was concerned, i.e. the engine, plus cooling system and the fuel tanks. Diesel engines are more efficient than petrol engines, that means there is more heat loss with a petrol engine compared to a diesel engine. This in turns require larger cooling capacity (radiators) for a petrol engine compared to a diesel of similar power. The diesel also uses substantially less fuel than the petrol engine to achieve the same performance. The fuel tanks can therefore be smaller in the diesel-powered tank<sup>(47.3)</sup>.


    During the development of their diesel engines, Mercedes also experimented with mounting the engine cross-wise in the tank, coupled to a 90° angled drive to take the drive to the front-mounted gearbox. This did not result in a significant space saving however<sup>(47.2)</sup>.


    Following the campaign in Poland, a number of problems and failures of various components were identified in Daimler Benz built Pz. Kpfw. III (Ausf. G). Daimler-Benz complained that the use of many of these suspension, transmission, and other components were forced upon them by Wa Prüf 6 and that their reputation was being damaged by the failure of these components. In October 1939, MB therefore received permission to design a new tank without any interference from Wa Prüf 6. This was to be known as the VK 20.01 (D). A month later, engineers and directors from DB met to discuss the new tank and it was decided that it would be fitted with a new diesel engine, the MB 809<sup>(47.4)</sup>.


    From the above mentioned projects, there finally emerged a light and compact diesel engine, suitable for the new tank. The design was finalized in June 1940. The first engine ran on a test stand in February 1941 and acceptance trials took place in March 1941.


    The original version of the engine displaced 25,5 litres. This was followed by a “medium” version of the engine which displaced 21.7 litres but still achieved 400 PS at 2200 rpm. This version of the engine was fitted with conventional, cast iron, individual cylinders and it weighed 1250 kg. By using individual steel cylinders with welded on, sheet metal, cooling jackets, and reducing the displacement to 19,7 litres, the weight was reduced to 1120 kg and the engine was shortened by 10 cm. By allowing the maximum speed of the engine to increase to 2400 rpm, 400 PS was still achieved. The use of welded cooling jackets not only lightened and shortened the engine, but also allowed bigger valves to be fitted. This technique had previously been used on aero engines<sup>(47.5)</sup>. For the final version of the engine, the displacement and weight was further reduced, to 17,5 litres, and 820 kg. This version of the engine produced 360 hp at 2400 rpm. The engine was an overhead valve unit, with two valves per cylinder, 7 main bearings and a compression ratio of 14.5:1<sup>(47.6)</sup>.


    Testing of the diesel-engines VK 20.01(DB) started at Kummersdorf in mid-1941. After the invasion of Russia, in June 1941, and contact with the larger and heavier Russian tanks, there was no further interest in a new 20-25 ton tank and further development of the VK 20.01, and its DB809 engine, was abandoned. On December 22, 1941, a report to the directors of DB read: “Based on the experience in the Russian campaign, the new tank just developed by Daimler-Benz, is now obsolete<sup>”(47.7)</sup>.


    Technically, the MB 809 is a remarkable engine for the period in which it was developed. A normally aspirated diesel that developed over 20 hp/litre (8,5 hp/litre/1000 rpm) is a notable achievement in 1941. In the early seventies of the previous century, M.A.N., Daimler Benz and Deutz all developed a series of commercial diesel engines with a bore and stroke of 125x130 mm. These engines typically produced 20 hp/l at 2500-2650 rpm (8 hp/litre/1000 rpm), without turbocharging. The Deutz F10L413F, for instance, was an air-cooled, V10 diesel of 16 litre displacement that produced 320 PS at 2500 rpm, without turbocharging, but it weighed over 1000 kg. This was a direct injection diesel engine produced 30 years after the MB 809, it produced less power/displacement than the latter yet weighed 25% more<sup>(47.8)</sup>.

    Prof. Porsche envisaged an electrically driven tank transporter for the Tiger I, in November 1940. It would have been powered by the MB 819 diesel engine. This V-12 unit was a supercharged version of the 17,5 litre MB 809B. It produced 400 sustained metric hp at 2400 rpm and weighed 865kg. In typical Porsche fashion, the engine drove a generator which in turn provided current for the electrical motors driving both the front and rear units of the transporter<sup>(48.1) </sup>. This project did not proceed beyond the drawing board however.

    Simultaneously with Mercedes, Klöckner-Humbold-Deutz was also working on a diesel engine for the VK 20. This was supposed to be ready for production by the end of 1940. This was an unusual unit, in more ways than one. Firstly, it was an eight cylinder radial where typical aircraft, single row radials were either 7 or 9 cylinders. It was water-cooled where aircraft radials are inevitably air-cooled and it was a two-stroke engine. The engine weighed only 450kg (the similar powered MB 809 weighed more than 800 kg). 


    A prototype had been built, or was being built, when development was stopped, for the same reason as the MB809, i.e. the cancelled requirement for a new 20-25 ton tank.<sup>(49.1).</sup> It is not clear whether this engine ever ran on a test bench. 


    It is interesting to compare this engine with the American Guiberson T-1020 radial diesel engine that powered some tanks, landing craft of the Navy, etc. The Guiberson  engine, like the other radials that saw service in tanks, was originally designed as an aircraft engine. It was an air-cooled, 4-stroke, 9 cylinder diesel of 16,7 litre displacement and it weighed less than 300 kg in aircraft form (A-1020). It would have been significantly heavier with the cooling fan, shrouds, etc. attached for tank use. For aircraft use it produced 310 hp continuously but for tank use (T1020), it was limited to 250 hp<sup>(49.2)</sup>. The power to displacement ratio for the Guiberson was 15 hp/litre (7.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm), for a BMEP of  about 6.7 Bar (97 psi).


    The BMEP of the Deutz radial was fairly low (5,2 Bar), but a 2-stroke engine only produces half the BMEP of a similar powered four-stroke engine, at the same rpm. The contemporary US GM 6V-71 two-stroke diesel engine had a similar BMEP.  


    The T8 X113 engine was based on the Deutz’s experience with the Dz700 diesel engine. This was a small, two-stroke, 8-cylinder, radial engine, developed in 1936, for the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, i.e for aircraft use. It had a bore and stroke of 80x100mm for a displacement of 4 litres, and it developed 158 hp at 2800 rpm. The engine reportedly weighed only 55kg<sup>(49.3)</sup>.

    Before the development of efficient, compact superchargers or turbochargers for diesel engines, two-stroke operation was an attractive option for increasing the power of a normally aspirated diesel engine while keeping size and weight as low as possible. Junkers developed the Jumo 204, 205, 206, 207 and 208 series of 2-stroke diesel engines for aircraft in the 1930s and 1940s<sup>(49.3)</sup>. Even after WW2, there was still interest in normally aspirated, 2-stroke diesels as potential powerplants for tanks. Hanomag developed an 850 hp, 2-stroke, V-12, diesel engine as an alternative powerplant for the Leopard 1 tank, in the late 1950s. In the end though, the 10-cylinder, 4-stroke, MB 838 engine with mechanical superchargers was selected for this tank<sup>(49.4)</sup>. Various turbocharged models of the Detroit diesel 53 series, 71 series and 92 series engines were also used in armoured vehicles during the sixties, seventies and eighties of the previous century<sup>(49.5)</sup>.

    This engine was intended for use in the Panther II, and Tiger II, and eventually for other projects such as the E 50. Development of the engine was started about a year later than the two air-cooled diesels (Sla-16 and MAN-Argus) that were being developed for the same purpose, when it became clear that these engines were not going to be available for production as quickly as initially anticipated. It was a V-8, two-stroke, liquid-cooled diesel, more compact, lighter, cheaper and simpler than the Sla 16 or MAN-Argus units. It also had the advantage that the cylinder heads were easily accessible from the top of the engine bay and it apparently required about the same amount of space to install as the Maybach HL230 engine. It was expected to be ready for production by the end of 1945 and was expected to become the engine of choice for the Panther<sup>(50.1)</sup>. 

51. Sla-16 (Porsche type 203) X-16: 

    Introduction:	Planned for mid-1945.


    Configuration: 	X-16


    Displacement: 	36.5 litres (2227 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 135x160


    Type:		Four-stroke, turbocharged.


    Cooling:		Air


    Fuel:		Diesel


    Power: 		575 Kw Kw (770 hp) at 2200 rpm. 21 hp/litre; 9.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		2500N.m. (1850 ft.lb) at 2200 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.7 Bar (126 psi)


    Mps:		11.7 m/s (38 fps) at 2200 rpm.


    This engine is usually referred to as the Sla-16 (Sla: Simmering-luftgekühlt-aufgeladen), i.e. Simmering, air-cooled, turbocharged. It was designed by Porsche engineer Paul Netzker, but developed by the Austrian firm of Simmering-Graz-Pauker, in response to the “AG für luftgekülte Dieselmotoren” (Requirement for air-cooled diesel engines), published in July 1942<sup>(51.1)</sup>. It was at that time envisaged that the engine would develop 900 PS. Development started in 1943. It was to replace the Maybach HL230 in the Panther and Tiger tanks. The HL230 was a very compact engine and the Sla-16 was supposed to fit into the same engine compartment. This resulted in an the unusual “X” lay-out, with four banks of 4 cylinders, arranged around a common crankshaft. The four-stroke diesel engine was air-cooled and fitted with two turbochargers developed by the Swiss company of Brown-Boveri. These provided 1,33 atmospheres of pressure at 28000 turbocharger rpm<sup>(51.2)</sup>. Compression ratio was 14.5:1 and the engine weighed 2250kg<sup>(51.3)</sup>.


    Germany had difficulties with the manufacture of turbochargers during WW2. This was partly due to patent right considerations but they also had a shortage of the essential metals (nickel and cobalt) to construct these devices that operated in temperatures up to 700°C. The Swiss company of Brown, Boveri & Cie were known for their expertise in building turbochargers<sup>(51.4)</sup>.


    The first Sla-16 engine ran in late 1943. By late 1944, extensive bench testing had been done and several engines had been constructed. According to an article in “The Military Engineer”, vol. 38 (1946), five engines were completed before the end of the war. The article states that tests of the engine were “satisfactory beyond expectations”<sup>(51.5)</sup>. It developed 770hp at 2200 rpm but the cooling fans absorbed about 90hp, resulting in a net output of about 680hp. One of the completed engines was possibly installed in a Panzerjäger Tiger, in early 1945, for trials purposes. This seems unlikely though as there is no mention of this in the minutes of the final meeting of the Panzer Commission that took place on January 23, 1945. At this meeting, it was mentioned that the engine was expensive (twice the price of an HL230 engine), that the bottom eight cylinders were poorly accessible once the engine had been installed and that, at that time (January 1945), the cooling fans were still unsatisfactory but new fans were expected within four weeks. The previously mentioned F.K.F.S. company was responsible for the design of the cooling system. In January 1945, production was, optimistically,  projected to start at the Steyr factory by the middle of 1945, with a one hundred, zero-series engines being produced<sup>(51.6)</sup>. 


    The Sla-16 was a complex, expensive engine which used twice as much raw materials as the Maybach HL230 engine. The reason for the  X-16 lay-out was the requirement that the engine fit into an unmodified Panther or Tiger hull. The engine therefore had to be no longer than the compact Maybach HL230 unit. To fit the engine, the outside hull of a Panther tank could indeed remain largely unaltered but the engine compartment would have had to had to be extensively modified as the Sla engine was much wider than the Maybach. The width included the cooling fans and oil coolers however and the latter fitted in the space where the radiators and fans of the water-cooled Maybach would normally be fitted.<sup>(51.7)</sup>. 


    An enlarged version of the X-16 design was also envisaged; the Porsche Type 212, X-16 engine. Lay-out would have been identical to the Sla-16 but the bore and stroke would be  increased to 150x170 mm, resulting in a cylinder displacement of 3 litres and a total engine displacement of 48 litres. This engine was intended to produce 1500 hp. A single cylinder trial engine ran before the Austrian factory was overrun by Russian forces but a complete engine was never produced. The engine was intended for the Pz. Kpfw. VIII Maus<sup>(51.8)</sup>. 


    The projected output of 1500 hp (31.25 hp/l) for this engine (Type 212) was very ambitious. This kind of performance for diesel tank engines only became available 30 years later with engines such as the MB 873 Ka-501 and other contemporary motors<sup>(51.9)</sup>. The Type 212 would probably have produced around 1000-1100 PS at its maximum rpm.


    Some authors also refer to an X-18 engine. No reference to such an engine has been found however and the construction of the X-16 engine is such that an X-18 would be nonsensical. The engine would be longer than the X-16 but only 2 instead of 4 extra pistons would be fitted. The design of the X-16 is such that the cylinder number will always vary by a factor of four, i.e. an X-12, X-16 or X-20, for instance. The new Russian T-14 Armata tank is fitted with an X-12 engine<sup>(51.10)</sup>.  Many X-type engines have also been developed for use in aircraft, in the past, generally without very much success.

    MAN, in cooperation with Argus, was awarded a contract to develop this engine in 1941. It consisted of two air-cooled, flat 8 (boxer), 4-stroke, diesel engines superimposed to form an H-16 engine. Each engine had its own crankshaft and the two crankshafts were geared together, to a single output shaft. After 3 years of development, bench trials of this engine began in 1944, in Berlin and Nurenberg. In January 1945 it was reported that the engine was about 3 months behind the Sla-16 engine in development. At the meeting of the Entwicklungskommission Panzer, held on January 23 1945, it was decided to continue development of the engine in case the Simmering engine turned out not to be successful. The engine was intended for the Panther but was longer than the Maybach and would have required a longer hull<sup>(52.1)</sup>.


    This type of lay-out has been attempted by other manufacturers, especially for aircraft engines. The most successful was the British Napier-Sabre engine, a liquid-cooled, 24 cylinder (two flat-12 engines superimposed) affair, with sleeve valves, that powered the Hawker Typhoon and Tempest aircraft. Pratt & Whitney also attempted to develop engines with this configuration, with the X-1800, X-3130 and the X-3730. None of these engines achieved production however<sup>(52.2)</sup>.

A few Allied engines from WW2 and a few post-war engines will be briefly discussed for comparative purposes. 



53. Ford GAA, GAN, GAF:

    Introduction:	1940/41


    Configuration: 	V-8


    Displacement: 	17.9 litres (1095 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 137x152 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline


    Power: 		375 Kw (500 hp) at 2600-2800 rpm. 28hp/litre; 10.8 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1370 N.m. (1015 ft.lb) at 2600 rpm.


    BMEP: 		9.6 Bar (139 psi)


    Mps:		13.1 m/s (43 fps) at 2600 rpm.


    This engine was used in a number of Sherman models, and in the US M26 tank towards the end of WW2. It was derived from an aircraft engine design and was a contemporary of the Maybach HL210 and HL230 engines<sup>(53.1)</sup>. The original aircraft engine was a V-12 unit that was designed by Ford, with a bore and stroke identical to that of the British Merlin aircraft engine. The engine was intended for naval aircraft but the US Navy eventually decided to use air-cooled, radial engines and the liquid-cooled Ford engine was left an orphan. Ford then decided to develop it into a tank engine by shortening it to 8 cylinders.  


    The tank derivative was an aluminium, 60°, V-8, fitted with 4 valves per cylinder, with twin overhead camshafts per bank. Like its aircraft engine parent, it had twin magnetos and two sparkplugs per cylinder. The big V-8 was fed by two Stromberg carburettors and it weighed about 680 kg, dry. Depending on lay-out, attached accessories, and application, the suffix GAA, GAN or GAF was applied.


    This engine was regarded by its users as the best of the various engines used in the Sherman. It was also highly regarded by the Germans. They noted that it was closely comparable to the Maybach HL210 and HL230. The maximum sustained rpm range, the power-to-weight ratio and the BMEP were all similar for these engines. The torque characteristics of the Ford engine were regarded as superior to those of the Maybach 210 and 230 engines. The Ford engine achieved its maximum torque at about 55% of its maximum rpm, i.e. 1450 rpm. The Maybach HL230 achieved its maximum torque at about 70% of maximum rpm, i.e. 2100 rpm. In practice, the poorer torque characteristics of the Maybach engines were compensated by the use of  seven and eight speed gearboxes in the German tanks. Ing. Kniepkamp felt that the Ford was the best Allied tank engine from a construction and maintenance point of view<sup>(53.2)</sup>. 


    After the war, the engine returned to its V-12 roots and a V-12 derivative of the 8 cylinder GAA tank engine, the Ford GAC, was used in a few experimental US tanks such as the T1/M6 heavy tank, the T29E3 and the T32 heavy tank. In its most developed form, this 27 litre unit developed 770hp (28.5 hp/l)<sup>(53.3)</sup>. The GAC never entered large scale production as the US Army preferred the air-cooled Continental AV-1790 engine.


    One cannot help but speculate that the 12 cylinder GAC should have been the engine for the M26, which was left rather under-powered with the 8 cylinder GAF.

54. Rolls Royce (Rover) Meteor:

    Introduction:	1942


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	26.9 litres (1640 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 137x152 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline


    Power: 		450 Kw (600 hp) at 2400 rpm. 22.3 hp/litre; 9.3 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1780 N.m. (1320 ft.lb) at 2400 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.3 Bar (120 psi)


    Mps:		13 m/s (42.5 fps) at 2550 rpm.


    This engine was also derived from an aircraft engine, in this case the RR Merlin engine used in the Spitfire, Hurricane, Mustang, and many other aircraft. It was also a twin overhead camshaft engine, with 4 valves per cylinder. The tank engine had many differences from the aircraft variant however, including the lack of supercharging, the block was made of iron as opposed to aluminium for the aircraft engine and cast pistons were used instead of the forged units in the Merlin. It retained the ignition system of two spark plugs per cylinder, fed by twin magnetos<sup>(54.1)</sup>. The compression ratio varied between 6.1:1 to 7.1:1, depending on the model of the engine. 


    During the war, it developed 550-600 hp, in the Cromwell and Comet tanks. In the post-war Centurion tank it developed 650. The Conqueror heavy tank was fitted with the Meteor M120, no. 2, Mk 1A. This version of the engine was fitted with fuel injection and developed 810 hp at 2800 rpm<sup>(54.2)</sup>. In this form the horsepower/litre ratio was 30.1, the torque 2060 N.m. and the BMEP was 9.6 Bar.


    On paper, the Meteor was less powerful than the Maybach HL230. We know however that the Maybach was limited to 2500 rpm soon after its introduction and at that speed, output was similar to that of the Rolls Royce engine. Furthermore, the Meteor had significantly better torque characteristics than the Maybach, with a maximum torque output of 2100 N.m. at 1600 rpm compared to 1800 N.m. at 2100 rpm. for the Maybach. 


    What is interesting is that the Meteor, with carburettor, developed 650 hp in the post-war Centurion tank. By using fuel injection, the power was increased to 810 hp in the Conqueror. This was mainly achieved by increasing the maximum RPM from 2400 to 2800. At 2400 rpm, the fuel injected version of the engine produced around 700 hp, an increase of only 50 hp over the carburetted version. This does cast some doubt on Prof. Maybach’s claims for HL234 engine. The HL234 had the same displacement as the 700 hp HL230 but it (the HL234) was equipped with direct fuel injection and supposedly developed 885 hp (900 PS) by the end of the war, at the same 3000 rpm as the HL230. This seems unlikely, and even 800 hp is questionable, especially in view of the 860 hp maximum power of the fuel injected, 29.5 litre Maybach HL295.

55. Continental R975:

    Introduction:	1939


    Configuration: 	9 cylinder radial


    Displacement: 	15.9 litres (1790 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 127x140 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline


    Power: 		300 Kw (400 hp) at 2400 rpm. 25hp/litre; 10.5 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1190 N.m. (880 ft.lb) at 2400 rpm.


    BMEP: 		9.3 Bar (135 psi)


    Mps:		11.2 m/s (37 fps) at 2400 rpm.


    This engine was very different to the various German wartime armoured vehicle engines in that it was a radial engine, derived from the Wright R-975 Whirlwind aircraft engine. It was used in numerous Allied tanks and related armoured vehicles. Output varied from 340-400 hp, depending on the installation; some sources give as high as 435 hp, although this may due to gross versus net horsepower issues<sup>(55.1)</sup>. At 400 hp, it was an efficient engine with excellent power-to-weight, horsepower/litre and BMEP figures. The dry weight was about 520 kg.

    _Eight Continental R975 tank engines of the Wheatcroft collection. Note the cooling fans and shrouds._


    As mentioned previously, MAN did, experimentally, install radial engines in two Panther tanks in late 1943. The engine used was the BMW 132 Dc, a 9-cylinder radial of 27.7 litres. The BMW 132  engine was  descended from the Pratt & Whitney Hornet, for which BMW acquired a production licence in 1928. Like the American R975, the engine was fitted with a cooling fan for tank use. In addition, a drop-down gearbox was fitted. The standard drive shaft between the engine and gearbox in the Panther was too low to attach directly to the crankshaft of the radial engine. The drop down box corrected this. For tank fitment, the engine was carburetted and normally aspirated while most of the aircraft versions were fitted with direct fuel injection and supercharging. The tank version developed  520 hp at 2000 rpm.


    Tests with this setup were apparently satisfactory and MAN suggested building 20 more Panthers with this engine for extended trials. One must keep in mind that at this time, the big Maybach engines were proving to be very unreliable and MAN was keen to find a potentially more reliable alternative for the Panther. In the end, this did not proceed however as it became clear that the lower cylinders, including valves and spark plugs, were not accessible for servicing in the narrow confines of the Panther’s engine compartment. To access these important and maintenance sensitive components, the engine would have had to be removed from the tank! The other problem was that Germany could barely produce enough of these engines for their aircraft. The BMW 132s was mainly used to power the Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft<sup>(55.2)</sup>.


    It is interesting to speculate what might have been in this regard. Germany actually produced two suitable air-cooled radial engines in the power range to suit the Panther: the BMW 132 of 27,7 litres (1690 cu. inch) and the BMW Bramo 323, also a nine cylinder radial, that displaced 26,8 litres (1637 cu. inch). In aircraft use, with superchargers, these engines produced up to about 1000 hp. Normally aspirated, one would expect them to have produced about 600-650 hp at 2400 rpm<sup>(55.3)</sup>.


    Because of the design of a radial engine, with lots of important bits at the bottom, they are only really suitable for tanks with the transmission at the front, so that the engine can be approached from the rear for maintenance. This lay-out is found in the Sherman tank, for instance, but also in the German tanks. To fit a radial, the rear of the Panther’s hull would have had to be redesigned to allow for engine hatches but this should not have created any great problems. The BMW 132 radial, which had been produced in Germany from 1933, would likely have been more reliable than the problem-ridden Maybach HL230, especially during the initial deployment of the tank. 


    There are however several problems which would have had to be solved in this hypothetical situation. Production capacity would have had to be found to produce the required number of engines. Maybach alone produced more than 8000 HL210/230 engines during the war while a number of other manufacturers also produced significant numbers of these engines. Auto-Union, for instance, was producing about 800 engines per month by mid-1944<sup>(25.5)</sup>. 


    In the intrigue-ridden Nazi Germany of the forties, loyalties and favouritism played important roles and Prof. Maybach, a personal friend of Hitler, would have been piqued, to say the least, if a BMW aircraft engine had been selected for the new tank instead of a Maybach unit. Finally, the big radial produced about 15-20% more torque than the HL230 engine. The fragile final drive of the Panther would likely have been even more unreliable with this engine than with the Maybach V-12. 


 



56. The Continental AV-1790:

    Introduction:	1947


    Configuration: 	V-12


    Displacement: 	29.3 litres (1791 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 146x146 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Air


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline, fuel injected.


    Power: 		600 Kw (810 hp) at 2800 rpm. 27.6 hp/litre; 9.8 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		1950 N.m. at 2200 rpm.


    BMEP: 		8.8 Bar (128 psi)


    Mps:		13.6 m/s (45 fps) at 2800 rpm.


    This unit was not a wartime engine but was developed soon after WW2. It is included here because it is more or less a contemporary of the Maybach HL234 and HL295 petrol engines and of the British Meteor engine of the Conqueror tank. It first appeared in the prototypes of the T30 heavy tank, in 1947<sup>(56.1)</sup>. It later powered the US M47 tank and early versions of the M48. It was itself later replaced by the iconic AVDS-1790, a diesel fuelled version of the same engine<sup>(56.2)</sup>. Like the two mentioned German engines and the Meteor M120, it was a fuel-injected, petrol, four-stroke, normally aspirated engine, but it was air-cooled as opposed to the liquid-cooled Maybach and Meteor engines. As can be seen, its performance was very similar to that of the HL295.


    It is interesting to note that the under-square dimensions (stroke larger than the bore diameter) seen in all the large WW2 engines, was no longer present in this engine: it is of “square” design, i.e., the bore and stroke are identical. This allows relatively high revolutions, and high output, with moderate mean piston speed (mps).

    BMEP: 		7.3 Bar (106 psi)


    Mps:		12.1 m/s (40 fps) at 3200 rpm.


    These side valve (“flat head”) engines were used in large numbers during WW2 to power light tanks, such as the M5, M8 and M24, sometimes in twin installations. Weight was approximately 265 kg and the compression ratio just over 7:1. Output is usually given in net horsepower, as 110 hp, while other sources give 130 hp. Hunnicutt gives quite a large difference between gross and net horsepower, i.e.148 gross and 110 horsepower net<sup>(57.1)</sup>.


    As a single engine it approximated the Maybach HL45 in output. In a double installation, it was in the power class of the HL120.

58. Hercules JXD:

    Introduction:	1937


    Configuration: 	Inline six-cylinder.


    Displacement: 	5.3 litres (323 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 102x108 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline


            Power: 	105 Kw (140 hp) gross at 3200 rpm. 26.4 hp/litre (gross); 8.25 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		312 N.m. (230 ft.lb) at 3200 rpm.


    BMEP: 		7.4 Bar (107 psi)


    Mps:		11.5 m/s (38 fps) at 3200 rpm.


    This engine was used in the M8 and M20 armoured cars used by the US and her allies, as well as in numerous trucks during WW2. It had two overhead valves per cylinder, a compression ratio of 6,5:1, and the dry weight was approximately 340 kg. The output of the engine was usually given as 110 net hp<sup>(58.1)</sup>. It was broadly comparable to the Maybach HL54, 57 and 62 engines.


    This engine, introduced in 1937, was relatively modern. It had overhead valves and the stroke was quite short; it is only slightly under-square. This is reflected in the low mean piston speed.

59. Rolls Royce B80 No.1 Mk6D:

    Introduction:	1947


    Configuration: 	Inline 8 cylinder.


    Displacement: 	5.8 litres (346 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 89x114 mm.


    Type:		Four-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid


    Fuel:		Petrol/gasoline


    Power: 		123 Kw (165 hp) at 3750 rpm. 28.6 hp/litre; 7.6 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		315 N.m. (235 ft.lb) at 3750 rpm. 


            Maximum: 350 N.m. (260 ft.lb) at 2300 rpm.


    BMEP: 		6.9 Bar (100 psi)


    Mps:		14.2 m/s (47 fps) at 3750 rpm.


    This was an inline 8-cylinder engine (“straight-8”) that powered the British Alvis Saracen APC and the Saladin armoured car. Development started in 1943 but production only started in 1947. The engines were designed to offer a highly unitized series of engines, i.e 4, 6, and 8 cylinder units sharing as many components as possible. Amongst other applications, the inline four cylinder engine was used in the Austin Champ, the inline six-cylinder in the Alvis Ferret scout car and the inline eight cylinder in the Saladin armoured car and the Saracen APC. A bored-out version (95.2mm x 114mm; 6.5 litre) was used in the Stalwart amphibious truck as well as in the German Schutzenpanzer 12-3 MICV. This version produced 220 hp at 4000 rpm, with 420 N.m. (312 ft.lb) torque at 2400 rpm<sup>(59.1)</sup>.


    The engines all had 2 valves per cylinder, used carburettors, and compression ratio’s varied between 6.4 and 7.25. In early engines, an aluminium cylinder head was used but later engines were all cast iron. The weight of the 8-cylinder B80 was about 250 kg<sup> </sup>.


    Somewhat unusual was the construction of the cylinder head. The removable head housed the inlet valve but the exhaust valve was in the cylinder block; a so-called F-head design. This head design allowed for a large inlet valve (it did not share the head with an exhaust valve) and supposedly lead to a quieter running engine. As opposed to most post-war engines, it was still a thoroughly under-square (long stroke) unit. The stroke-to-bore ratio was 1.28. 


    By 1946, a straight eight could be regarded as an odd choice for an armoured vehicle engine. It is both long and high, features not greatly appreciated by armoured fighting vehicle designers. Except for the B80, all 8-cylinder engines designed after WW2 were V-8 or flat-eight (boxer) configuration.


    In displacement, the engine is similar to the Maybach HL57 but the British engine is of a much later design. The B80 is more comparable to the Maybach HL50 which was designed in the early forties. The German engine, with two overhead valves per cylinder was of a more conventional design than the F-head Rolls Royce engine. Power was similar for the two units.

60. GM (Detroit Diesel) 6-71:

    Introduction:	1938

    Displacement: 	7.1 litres (433 c.i.). Bore and stroke: 108x127 mm.


    Type:		Two-stroke.


    Cooling:		Liquid


    Fuel:		Diesel


    Power 		103 Kw (138 hp) to 156 Kw (210 hp) at 2100 rpm. 19.4-29.5 hp/litre.


    			9.2 – 14 hp/litre/1000 rpm.


    Torque:		470 N.m. (350 ft.lb) – 710 N.m. (530 ft.lb)at 2100 rpm.


    BMEP: 		4.1 – 6.2 Bar (60 – 90 psi). 


    Mps:		8.9 m/s (29 fps) at 2100 rpm.


    This iconic, two-stroke diesel engine went into production in 1938 and saw very wide use in various applications during WW2. It remained in continuous production until 1995. The straight six (inline six cylinder) engine was around 140 cm long, 75 cm wide and 105 cm high, with a weight of around 1000 kg<sup>(60.1)</sup>.


    In WW2 it was used in the British Valentine tank as the GM 6004 engine and in a twin installation in some models of the Sherman tank, the M10 tank destroyer and the M2A2E3 light tank, amongst others<sup>(60.2)</sup>. The Shermans fitted with this engine were mainly exported to Russia where diesel fuel was the norm for tanks and the light tanks saw some use in Burma. The twin installation was known as the GM 6046 engine<sup>(60.1)</sup>. The engine was also used extensively for the powering of LCVP landing craft and in a quad installation for powering larger LCI landing craft.


    Various outputs have been given depending on the vehicle into which the engine was installed. For the British Valentine tank, the first model to be fitted with the GM engine was the Mk. IV and in this tank it developed 138 hp. In the Mk. IX, it developed 165 hp (this is used in the table) and finally, in the Mk. XI, the engine developed 210 hp<sup>(60.3)</sup>. The last figure is notable. In this version, the engine developed 29 hp/litre (14 hp/litre/1000 rpm)! 


    In a presentation on tank engines, given in Berlin in February 1945, Dipl. Ing. Esser stated that the output of the 6046 powerpack (twin GM 6-71 engines) was 420 PS, i.e. 210 PS (about 207 imperial hp) per engine<sup>(60.4)</sup>. Other sources state that the Sherman M4A2, the version fitted with the GM 6046 installation, developed 370 hp, i.e. 185 hp per engine. It is worth noticing that the twin installation (GM4046) weighed over 2000 kg, and to compare this to the weight of the Ford GAA (about 700 kg), and to the Continental R-975 (about 520 kg), all in the some power output range.


    Like other 2-stroke engines, the BMEP is relatively low, varying between 4.1 Bar and 6.2 Bar, depending on the version. The power output is however (very) high for the displacement, especially for a diesel engine. A BMEP of 6.2 Bar in a 2-stroke engine actually equates to a BMEP of 12.4 Bar in a similar sized 4-stroke engine. The only disadvantage of two-stroke diesels compared to four-stroke units of similar power, is that they were less fuel efficient<sup>(14)</sup>.


    As discussed previously, 2-stroke diesels were a potentially attractive solution for creating relatively compact, powerful diesel engines, before the use of superchargers and turbochargers for diesel engines became de rigeur. Deutz was developing the TX113 V8, two-stroke diesel, by the end of WW2. This 32.7 litre unit was expected to produce 700 hp and was expected to become the engine of choice for the Panther by the end of 1945, had the war continued<sup>(49.1)</sup>.


    Hanomag developed an 850 hp, 2-stroke, V-12 diesel engine as an alternative powerplant for the Leopard 1 tank, in the late 1950s<sup>(49.4)</sup>. A four-stroke Mercedes diesel was however selected for the production model of the Leopard I. The most (in)famous two-stroke diesel, actually multifuel, engine used in a Western tank is the Leyland L60 of the British Chieftain tank. This unit was based on the German Junkers Jumo aircraft engine designs. It was by all accounts a dismal piece of kit, being notoriously unreliable and never really reaching the power required from it until late in the production life of the tank<sup>(60.5)</sup>. 


    The Russians started with the development of  a 2-stroke tank engine in the nineteen fifties. They had experimented with such powerplants during WW2 and after the war, they acquired the German documentation from Junkers. Development of the tank engine was tortuous, with numerous problems, as in the case of the Junkers and the British L60, and production of the horizontal, 5 cylinder, 5TD engine only started in 1965. During the sixties and seventies, the 6-cylinder 6TD was developed. This eventually developed over 1000 hp, with turbocharging and went into production in the eighties. The 6TD engine is currently still being produced in the Ukraine, in a 1500 hp version<sup>(60.6)</sup>.

    This was possibly the most important single tank engine used in WW2. It powered all of the major Russian tanks used in the war and derivatives are still in production today. The engine was supposedly developed from a Hispano Suiza aircraft engine.


    The engine first ran in 1937 and was introduced in the T34 tank in 1939/40, and a more powerful version, sometimes referred to as the V-2K, was developed to power the KV-1 tank, and later the KV-2. This had higher injection pressures and maximum revolutions were  increased to 2000 rpm.


    For the Russians to have developed a light, compact, 500 hp tank engine during the nineteen thirties was an extraordinary technical feat. As mentioned previously, diesel engines at that time were generally enormous, cast-iron affairs, much bigger and heavier than petrol engines of equivalent power. The Russian was especially light, at 1000 kg, including the generator and fan. 				


            Length		Width		Height		Weight		


    Kahrkiv V2:		1.6 meters	0.84 meters	1.064 meters	1000 kg


    Maybach HL 230:		1.2 meters	0.97 meters	0.94 meters	1400 kg	


    It was constructed mainly of aluminium and had typical aircraft engine features such as 4 valves per cylinder, driven by overhead camshafts. Because of the construction of the crank, with one master connecting rod and one slave rod (articulated rod) per journal, the stroke and compression of the cylinders on the one bank were actually greater than on the other bank. The displacement per cylinder on the master bank was 3.18 litres, with a stroke length of 180 mm and a compression ratio of 15:1. On the slave bank, the displacement per cylinder was 3.3 litres, the stroke 186.7 mm and the compression ratio 15.8:1.


    The basic version of the engine (V-2-34) developed 500 hp at 1800 rpm and saw service in the T34 tank and derivatives. The V-2K developed 600 hp at 2000 rpm. This was used in the KV-1 and KV-2 tanks. A supercharged version, the V-2SN, was developed by fitting the supercharger from a Mikulin-38 aircraft engine to it. This produced 860 hp but was never produced in quantity. Later versions of the engine powered the T72 tank, producing 760 hp with the addition of a mechanical supercharger<sup>(61.1)</sup>.

    This engine is of interest as it is a Daimler Benz development; the same company that was responsible for the second world war MB engines previously discussed. 


    The MB 837 was initially developed by Daimler Benz in the fifties, at the request of Switzerland. It was intended for a new Swiss tank. It turned out as a large V-8, four-stroke engine, 4 valves per cylinder, with a single mechanical supercharger. The engine was constructed mainly of light alloy castings and it weighed 1450 kg, dry. It ran for the first time, on a test stand, in February 1955<sup>(62.1)</sup>. It was first used in the prototype Swiss Pz 61, in 1958. The tank was ordered into production in 1961 and entered service in 1965. A modified version of the Pz 61, the Pz 68 (prototype in 1968), entered service in 1971. This version of the tank used the same engine, slightly uprated to 660 hp<sup>(62.2)</sup>.


    During the early sixties, Germany developed two tank destroyers, one armed with a 90mm gun and the other with the HOT ATGW. These vehicles were otherwise identical and they were powered by a normally aspirated version of the engine used in the Swiss tanks<sup>(62.3)</sup>. The data for this unsupercharged version of the engine is shown in the table, to allow comparison to the various MB diesels of the forties. 


    The 8 cylinder MB 837 later gave rise to a V10 version, the MB838. This version had twin mechanical superchargers, developed 830 hp, and became the engine for the Leopard I tank<sup>(62.4)</sup>.
