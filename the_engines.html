<p>The engines below are not listed in any specific order. The Maybach company manufactured a bewildering array of engines for use in German fighting vehicles during WW2. These engines were all petrol fuelled and they will be discussed first, more or less in order of displacement and not chronologically. It is important to note this as two similar sized engines may have distinctly different performance ratings because one is from 1936, for instance, and the other from 1941. The Maybachs are followed by the other petrol engines and then the various diesels. At the end of the list, some contemporary Allied and other post-war engines are briefly discussed, to allow comparison with the German, WW2 engines.</p>

<h2>Maybach engines</h2>
<p>After the first world war, the most powerful petrol engines available were those developed for aircraft. Wa Prüf 6 decided, in the nineteen thirties, not to use these large, slow turning, high torque aircraft engines in tanks. The firm of Maybach was then instructed to produce smaller, high performance engines, on the cutting edge of technology, specifically for use in tanks and other combat vehicles. This company became the most important manufacturer of military vehicle engines in Germany, during WW2.</p>
<p>Numerous Maybach engines were developed during the 1930’s and 1940’s but many did not see production or were only produced in small numbers. Some of the engines that did go into production and service, were unfortunately insufficiently developed and tested, resulting in poor reliability, as we shall see. Because of the enormous demand for engines, Maybach engines were built in at least 8 factories across Germany and Austria during the war. By the end of the war, 140.000 Maybach engines for the German Military had been produced, totalling 40 million horsepower(39).</p>
<p>The German army never succeeded in standardizing on a few powerplants. Aside from the numerous Maybach engines used, many trucks also used their own  engines. The enormous variety of engines used resulted in a logistics nightmare for the German supply organisation and logistics units.</p>
<p>Maybach vehicle engines were identified by various connotations to indicate their functions and applications.  Some of the abbreviations/attachments used include the following(40).</p>

<p>For instance, a HL42 TRKM engine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HL: 	High performance engine.</li>
  <li>42:	Approximate engine displacement of 4.2 litres.</li>
  <li>TR:	Dry sump lubrication.</li>
  <li>K:	Clutch housing.</li>
  <li>M:	Magneto ignition.</li>
</ul>
<p>HL57 TRR engine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HL:	High performance engine</li>
  <li>57:	Approximate displacement (5.7 litres).</li>
  <li>TR:	Dry sump lubrication.</li>
  <li>R:	Belt-driven compressor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The absence of a “K” suggests no clutch housing. In German tanks, the engine was usually positioned at the back of the vehicle with the transmission at the front, between the driver and radio operator/machine gunner. The clutch was part of the transmission. Power was therefore delivered to the clutch and transmission by a shaft running directly from the engine to the clutch housing. There was no clutch housing on the engine itself.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the letter codes were/are not always used or complete. Most authors will simply refer to the “Maybach HL57” engine to indicate the basic engine, without specifying the various attachments or the application.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the Maybach engines discussed here are overhead valve engines, with 2 valves per cylinder. Even the large, powerful HL210 and HL230 engines had 2 valves per cylinder, operated by a single overhead camshaft. This is notable in view of the fact that similar Allied tank engines, such as the Rolls Royce Meteor and the Ford GAF, both derived from aircraft engines, used 4 valves per cylinder, with twin overhead camshafts. Despite this, the big Maybach engines delivered comparable horsepower per litre figures and similar BMEP to the two mentioned Allied engines.</p>
<p>The list below is certainly not all of the Maybach engines used during WW2 but does include the most numerous engine types. Many books have been written about German WW2 vehicles and data have obviously been taken over by many authors from previous publications. In this process, as mentioned previously, some corruption of the data has taken place and has been perpetuated. As far as possible, data have been corrected and rationalized.</p>

<p>In May 1942, the company of Adler started development of the Leichter Wehrmachtsschlepper (leWS, or lWS). This was a simplified halftrack intended to replace the 1-ton Demag halftrack (Sd. Kfz. 10). Three prototypes were built of which the first two were powered by the HL30. The third prototype had the HL42. Although production was intended to start in early 1943, the project did not advance past the prototypes(1.1).</p>

<p>Some sources state that the engine was a 4-cylinder(1.2), while others state that it was a 6-cylinder engine(1.3). The displacement is given as 3,11 litres(1.4) but unfortunately no other engine details are to be found, i.e. bore and stroke. The 4 cylinders and the bore and stroke given here (95x110) are guess work and are assumed to have been the same as those of the HL45, 6-cylinder engine. In a 4-cylinder engine, this equals 3118 cc.  It is therefore suggested that the HL30 was a 4-cylinder version of the 6-cylinder HL45.</p>

<p>These engines were also quite high revving for the time. The high power output is mainly due to the high rpm.</p>

<p>Various models of the HL42 (TUKRR, TRKM, etc.) were used in a number of halftracks, including the Sd. Kfz. 10 (Zgkw 1), and Sd. Kfz. 11 (Zgkw. 3), the Sd. Kfz. 250 & 251, and the sWS (schwererer Wehrmacht Schlepper)(3.1).</p>

<h3>About halftracks</h3>
<p>
  Germany developed an extensive array of advanced halftracks (sometimes referred to as “three quarter tracks”) before and during the war. These were known under various designations, i.e. as Sd. Kfz. (Sonderkraftfahrzeug) or as Zgkw. (Zugkraftwagen). Sonderkraftfahrzeug can be directly translated as “special powered vehicle”. It was the German ordnance inventory designation for vehicles specifically built for military purposes and was used for armoured and unarmoured halftracks, tanks, armoured cars, etc. The Sd. Kfz. designations of the halftracks have nothing to do with their size or power.
</p>
<p>
  Zugkraftwagen, directly translated, means “powered tractor” and this referred specifically to the series of halftracks. For instance, the Sd. Kfz. 10 was also known as the Zgkw. 1, i.e. “powered tractor for pulling 1-ton loads”.

<p>“Maultier” (Mule) was a generic term for a halftrack conversion of a standard truck. Many of these were built for service in the difficult conditions on the Eastern front and they were based on a number of different trucks, including Opel, Magirus Deutz, Mercedes and Alfa Romeo. Initially, the trucks were fitted with suspension units from Pz. Kpfw. 1 or Pz. Kpfw. 2 tanks but later a standard conversion employing a Horstman type suspension was used. This suspension was very similar to that used on the British Universal carriers (Bren carriers). The Maultier conversions used the standard truck engines.</p>

<p>NOTE: Most of the halftrack models were fitted with more than one model of engine, depending on when they were built, with later built vehicles receiving later and more powerful engines. The Sd. Kfz. 10, for instance, was initially fitted with the NL38 TRKM engine and later with the HL42 TRKM. The Sd. Kfz. 7 started life with the HL52 engine. This was later replaced by the HL57, then by the HL62 and finally with the HL64, in 1943. The big Sd. Kfz. 9 initially had the HL98, later the HL108 and finally, the HL120.</p>

<p>A number of these vehicles were fitted with partial or completely armoured bodies, or otherwise served as the basis of armoured vehicles. This usually resulted in the Sd. Kfz. number changing as numbers from 1 to 99 were used to designate unarmoured halftracks, 100 to 199 were used to designate tanks and tank-derived vehicles and 200-299 were used to designate other armoured vehicles such as armoured personnel carriers, armoured half-tracks, armoured cars, etc.</p>

<p>The light Sd. Kfz. 10 halftrack gave rise to the Sd. Kfz. 250 series of armoured reconnaissance halftracks while the Sd. Kfz. 11 gave rise to the many Sd. Kfz. 251 variants, mostly used as APCs. Some sWS vehicles were fitted with armoured cabs, as were some of the other heavy halftrack variants.</p>

<p>Used in the Pz. Kpfw. I, Ausf. C (VK 6.01) and Ausf. J (VK 18.01). Also in the HK p602 (DEMAG) and p603 (Hanomag) prototype halftracks (modified Sd. Kfz. 251). Widely varying power outputs reported by various sources: 105(4.1); 120(4.2); 150(4.3). It is certainly not 105 hp. That would have been very low for a Maybach engine of this displacement, developed in 1940, and would have left the mentioned vehicles badly under-powered. An output of 150 hp would result in 32 hp/litre but in view of the high rpm, this was possible. The output was probably in the 120-150 hp range, at 3800 rpm. Also see the notes on the HL90 and the HL100.</p>

<p>Used in the HKp605/606 simplified halftrack prototypes to replace the Sd. Kfz. 251, developed by DEMAG, and the prototypes of the “Kätschen” fully tracked APC (1944). These vehicles were not produced in quantity. High power to displacement ratio and high maximum rpm.</p>

<p>The displacement of the engine is given as 4995 cc by various sources. The bore and stroke are nowhere to be found. A bore and stroke of 100x106mm equals the known displacement of 4995 cc and is the same as the bore and stroke given for the HL90, and/or the HL100 (which see). Hundred and eighty horsepower from a 5-litre military engine is (very) high for this period. Note that the US Chrysler Military V8 petrol engine of the 1950’s displaced 361 c.i. (5.9 litres) and developed 191 gross horsepower at 4000 rpm. This was also on higher octane petrol than that used in Germany during the war. The 180 hp figure given for the HL 50 may therefore be too high. The figure of 9 hp/litre/1000 rpm is however possible; the HL210 produced 10 hp/litre/1000 rpm. Moore suggests that the V12, HL90 developed 320 hp. This would put the HL50 at 160 hp, which is probably more realistic. Also see the notes about the HL90 and HL100.</p>

<p>This engine was identical to the HL52, but with the stroke increased by 5 mm. The HL54 TUKRM was used in later versions of the Sd. Kfz. 6, (Zgkw. 5t), 5-ton halftrack. The earliest versions of the Sd. Kfz. 6, in 1935, were powered by a Maybach HL 35 engine (no details known). This was replaced by the HL 38 in 1936 and in 1939 the HL54 followed. This final version of the Sd. Kfz. 6 was also longer, with 2 extra road wheels. The model shown below is the later, longer version.</p>

<p>The same bore as the HL52 and HL54, but the stroke increased by another 5 mm over the HL54. Used in the Pz Kpfw IIa, and in the Sd. Kfz. 7 (Zgkw. 8t) from 1936 to 1938. In the Pz Kpfw II, it was replaced by the Maybach HL62, from chassis nr. 21001, to create the Ausführing b version of the tank. In the Sd. Kfz. 7, the HL57 was in turn replaced by the HL62, in 1937. The final version of this vehicle received the HL64, in 1943.</p>

<p>An increase of 5 mm of the stroke length, compared to the HL64, and 20 hp more output. It was used in a number of experimental upgraded versions of the Pz. Kpfw. II.</p>

<p>The VK9.01 (Pz. Kpfw. II Ausf. G) was a redesign of the Pz. Pkfw. II with the intention of increasing the top speed. The resulting tank had interleaved, large road-wheel, torsion bar suspension and was powered by the HL66P engine. It weighed 10.5 tons, for a power-to-weight ratio of 17 hp/ton. Although a prototype ran in 1939, production was delayed due to many modifications and eventually, only 12 were produced between April 1941 and February 1942.</p>

<p>The VK9.03 (Pz. Kpfw. II Ausf. H and M) was to have been the production version of the VK9.01. It was similar in design to the VK9.01 but was more heavily armoured and had a different transmission. Like its predecessor, production was delayed at first, and then cancelled completely.</p>

<p>The VK13.03 (Pz. Kpfw II Ausf L), also known as the Luchs (Lynx) was a variant of the Pz, Kpfw. II designed to be a fast reconnaissance tank. It was a further development of VK9.03, with a similar Schachtellaufwerk (interleaved, large road wheels) suspension and the Maybach HL66P engine, but more heavily armoured. The first 100 vehicles were to be produced with the 20 mm KwK L/55 cannon and after that, with the 50 mm KwK 39/L60. Only the first 100 vehicles were however produced before the order was cancelled.</p>

<p>With the HL66, the power-to-weight ratio was 16.2 hp/ton. (11.1). The engine had two overhead valves per cylinder, 8 journal bearing, i.e. conventional bearings, not the roller units found in the V-twelves. It was fed by two Solex 40 JFF, down draught carburettors(11.2).</p>

<p>Notable for this engine is the increase of 20 hp (12.5%) for an increase of only 300 cc displacement (4.6%), compared to the HL64 engine. This was achieved by allowing the engine to run up to 3200 rpm instead of 2800 rpm. As can be seen by the hp/litre/1000 rpm figures and the BMEP, the efficiency was no better than that of the HL62 and HL64, and the mean piston speed ended up being quite quite high.</p>

<p>This engine was developed from the Maybach DSO 8 engine. The DSO 8 was a V-12 engine used in the Maybach “Zeppelin” sportscar, where it developed 200 PS. In military guise, it developed 150 PS at 2000 rpm. The DSO 8 displaced 7978 cc from a bore and stroke of 92x100(12.1).</p>

<p>The HL85 powered the Sd. Kfz. 8 (Zgkw. 12t), 12-ton, heavy halftrack(12.2). This vehicle was initially built in 1934, powered by the 150 hp Maybach Type DSO 8 engine(12.3). In 1938, the DSO engine was replaced by the HL85 TUKRM.</p>

<p>
  This engine was used in prototypes of the light field howitzer leFH 18/40 L/28 mounted on the hybrid Pz. Kpfw. III/IV chassis. Two companies built prototypes of a Waffentrager in which a 105mm gun (10.5 cm leFH 18/40 L/28) was mounted on a hybrid Pz. Kpfw. III/IV chassis in such a way that it could be removed and fired off the ground. Rheinmetall-Borsig built 10 prototypes of which the first two were powered by the Maybach HL66 engine and the next 8 by the HL90P20k engine of 320hp. Krupp built prototypes of a competing design, the “10.5 cm. leFH 18/6 auf Waffenträger Geschütswagen III/IV (Heuschrecke)”. Ten of these vehicles were produced in the final months of 1943 and production was intended to start at the end of 1944 or beginning of 1945. In the end, neither of these vehicles went into production however, as they did not provide significant advantages over existing vehicles.
</p>
<p>
  Some sources state that the Heuschrecke prototypes (Krupp) were also powered by the HL90 and that the production vehicles were to have been powered by the HL100 engine of 420 hp. Moore however states that the Heuschrecke prototypes were powered by the standard 300 hp, HL120 TRM engine.
</p>
<p>
  The HL90 engine was also used in the Flakpanzer für S FlaK (8.8 FlaK auf Sonderfahrgestell). This was a modified chassis based on the Pz. Kpfw. IV. Initially, it mounted an 8.8cm FlaK 36 L/56 anti-aircraft gun. This was later replaced by the 8.8 cm FlaK 41 L/75.
</p>
<p>
  There are some incongruities concerning this engine. The displacement is given as 9990 cc by all available sources. This is, incidentally, exactly twice the displacement of the 6-cylinder HL50, which was also introduced in 1941. If this displacement is correct, the designation HL90 for this engine would not conform to the standard Maybach nomenclature. It seems possible/likely that the bore and stroke of the HL90 may actually have been 95x110, i.e. the same as the HL45, resulting in a displacement of 9356 cc. This would suggest that the four-cylinder HL30, six-cylinder HL45 and the twelve-cylinder HL90 were all part of the same engine family, with the same bore and stroke. This is speculation however.
</p>
<p>
  Various power outputs are mentioned for the HL90 engine: 200, 320 hp, or 360 hp. Two hundred hp is certainly too low and incorrect. The most likely figure is 320 hp at 3800 rpm. At a displacement of 10 litres, this would be 32 hp/litre which is high but not impossible. At 360 hp it would have been 36 hp/litre which would have been very high for a military engine from this era. The highly rated HL210, developed at about the same time, developed 30.5 hp/litre at 3000 rpm. The stated output of the HL45 was 150 hp. If the HL90 was indeed a V-12 version of the 6-cylinder HL45, the output would have been around 300-320 hp. This, again, is speculation but does conform to the data provided by Moore.
</p>
<p>
  The authoritative book by Von Senger und Etterlin, “Die Deutschen Panzer”, refers to the HL90 as a six-cylinder engine. All other sources however state that it is a 60° V-12 unit.

In 1939 it was replaced by the Maybach HL108 in this vehicle. The Zgkw. 18 was the biggest and most powerful of the German halftracks.</p>

<p>In 1941/2, Prof. Maybach suggested that the plethora of engines being produced during the 1930s and early 1940s could be markedly reduced by using just a few models. He proposed 4 engines: a 4-cylinder HL 33, a 6-cylinder HL50, an 8-cylinder HL 67, and a 12-cylinder HL100. These engines would share as many parts as possible (pistons, sleeves, valves, rocker arms, connecting rods, bearings, etc.), and they would all have the same bore and stroke(15.1). The single cylinder displacement would have been about 830 cc.</p>

<p>Spielberger’s book on the Panther depicts a diagram, by Maybach, showing the development of tank engine compartment size relative to horsepower between 1935 and 1942. The engines are stratified chronologically. For the period 1935-1938, the NL38 and the HL62, HL120, HL190 and HL320 engines are mentioned. For the period 1938-1940, the HL45, HL66, HL116, HL150 and HL224 engines are included. For the period 1941/42, the HL50, HL100, and HL230 engines are mentioned. Interestingly enough, the HL90 engine does not feature in this diagram. In the diagram, Maybach suggested that the HL50 would produce 200 hp and the HL100, 400hp(15.1).</p>

<p>As previously discussed, it seems unlikely that HL90 displaced 9990cc as presented in most sources. The 9990 cc engine was most likely the HL100. Spielberger gives 9990 cc as the displacement for both the HL90 and the HL100(15.2). It seems that the HL50 and the HL100 were new engines developed in 1941/42, with relatively short strokes (106 mm) to allow high rpm and high power output, and that they were part of the building block (Baukastensystem) series of new engines proposed by Maybach. With a relatively short stroke, the mean piston speed was kept low despite high maximum revolutions (12,6 m/s at 4000 rpm). According to the presentation by Maybach, these engines were to have produced about 33 metric hp per cylinder (40 PS/litre), i.e. 130 PS for the 4-cylinder, 200 PS for the 6-cylinder, 265 PS for the V-8 and 400 PS for the V-12.</p>

<p>The high power output (40 hp/litre) was mainly due to the high maximum RPM which was in turn made possible by the relatively short stroke. The hp/litre/1000 rpm and the BMEP figures are high but no higher than those of the contemporary Maybach HL210 engine.</p>

<p>Used in the Pz. Kpfw. III Ausf. A-D, the Pz. Kpfw. IVa and the Sd. Kfz.9 (Zgkw. 18t) 18-ton halftrack. In the tanks, the HL108 was replaced by the HL120 in 1937, and in the halftrack, in 1938(16.1).</p>

<p>The HL108 was, like the later V-12 Maybachs, a 60° V-12 utilising a tunnel type crankcase, with 7 roller main bearings, and two overhead valves per cylinder, activated by one overhead camshaft per head. Compression ratio 6.5:1. It was fed by two Solex JFF2 down-draught carburettors.</p>

<p>Although the cooling arrangements differed between the Pz Kpfw III and IV, in both vehicles it was designed to provide adequate cooling to 30°C (85°F)(16.2).</p>

<p>As for most of these engines, reported output varies from source to source. Typical was 250-260 at 3000 rpm maximum, and 230 hp at 2600 rpm, continuous rating(16.3).</p>

<p>In 1938, Daimler Benz was awarded a contract to design a new tank to replace the Pz. Kpfw. III. By December 1938, they had completed the design of the VK 20.01(III). It was one of the first tanks to be fitted with a Schachtellaufwerk suspension of large, interleaved roadwheels, based on the Kniepkamp designed suspension found on the various German halftracks. The VK 20.01(III) was to be powered by either a Mercedes diesel engine or by a Maybach, 6 cylinder petrol engine, the Maybach HL 116, which developed 300 PS at 3300 rpm(17.1). This tank never went into production.</p>

<p>In January 1937, Wa Prüf 6 of the Heereswaffenamt instructed Henschel to produce a chassis for a 30-ton tank, and Krupp to develop a turret, mounting a short-barrelled 75 mm gun. This tank was initially referred to as the “Begleitwagen” (B.W.) (escorting vehicle), later as the “Infanteriewagen” (I.W.) (infantry tank) and finally as the “Durchbruchswagen” (D.W.) (breaching tank). In November 1939 the design came to be referred to as the VK 30.01(H); the “H” for Henschel. Two chassis were constructed by Henschel: D.W. 1 and D.W. 2, both powered by the Maybach HL120 engine. Following testing of these vehicles, Henschel redesigned the chassis and fitted a new engine, the Maybach HL 116. Both the Maybach HL190 (375 PS) and the HL150 (400 PS) were suggested as possible alternative powerplants for this vehicle(17.2).</p>

<p>NOTE: Thomas Jentz mentions that Krupp also started the development of a new tank, the VK 20.01(K), in May 1940. Krupp created sketches of a chassis that could mount either the Maybach HL 116 or the HL 115(17.3). No other information is available about an “HL 115” engine; it is almost certainly a misprint for HL150. The proposed VK 20.01(K) never saw the light however.</p>

<p>The HL 116 engine was installed in the 3 prototype chassis of the Henschel VK 30.01, in 1941/2, coupled to a Maybach Variorex gearbox in 2 vehicles and an Olvar gearbox in the third. The Variorex gearboxes were semi-automatic, pre-selector boxes that utilised vacuum created by the engine to operate the gearbox(17.4). The Olvar transmissions were similar to the Variorex but utilised oil-pressure (hydraulics) to effect the gear changes(17.5).</p>

<p>The proposed 30 ton, Pz. Kpfw. VI tank never went into production. The six prototype Krupp turrets for the 30-ton tank were incorporated into the Atlantikwall. One chassis was used for trials and as a base tractor while 128mm guns were mounted on two chassis to create Panzerselbstfahrlafette für 12,8 K40 self-propelled guns(17.6).</p>

<p>Some sources give a maximum output of 320 hp and/or a maximum rpm of 3300 for the HL 116(17.7). In his book on the Tiger I, Jentz suggests 300 hp/3000 rpm(17.8). At 3300 rpm, the mean piston speed would have been 16.5 m/s. This is excessive. At 3000, it would have been 15 m/s; still quite high. It is possible that the engine could indeed produce 300-320 hp at 3300 on a test bench but in practice, the maximum allowable rpm would have been 3000, with the maximum sustained rpm being about 2500 (about 250 hp). This puts it in the same class as the HL120, V-12 engine.</p>

<p>Some authors have suggested that the engine might have been a V-12(17.9). This is incorrect; it was an inline (straight) 6-cylinder engine(17.10). Maybach Motorenwerk produced three HL 116 engines in 1940, eleven in 1941, three in 1942 and a single one in 1943(17.11).</p>

<p>Although the VK30.01 never went into production, it is part of the genealogy of the Tiger I tank. “VK” stands for “Vollketten”, i.e. “fully tracked”. The first numeral states the ball park intended weight of the vehicle, in this case 30 tons, while the second numeral is for the first prototype design.</p>

<p>VK designations were used when tank chassis were ordered or in development. Numerous “VK’s” were developed or proposed during WW2, for instance the VK6.01, VK9.01, VK16.01, VK16.02, VK18.01,VK30.01, VK45.01, etc.</p>

<p>As described above, the VK30.01 chassis developed from the B.W. (verstärkt), I.W., and D.W., with a turret by Krupp, mounting a 75mm gun. In June 1940, a requirement arose for a tank in the 30-ton class mounting a 105 mm infantry support gun, in a turret with 10 cm armour. The tank would weigh around 36 tons and became known as the VK36.01. In May 1941, the idea for the low velocity gun was dropped and it was decided to arm the tank with the high velocity, taper bore, Waffe 0725. It was to be powered by a Maybach HL174 engine of 450 hp, through a Maybach Olvar 40 12 16 transmission and Henschel L600 steering gear. The vehicle had eight pairs of large, interleaved (geschachtelde) road wheels and torsion bar suspension. A single VK36.01 chassis was completed (see later, under the Maybach HL174 heading)(17.12).</p>

<p>In 1939, Porsche was allowed to independently design a 30-ton tank. This vehicle became the Typ 100, or VK30.01 (P). Only a single chassis was built. When the decision was made to mount the 88mm L56 KwK 36 gun on a tank, Porsche redesigned the Typ 100 into the 45 ton Typ 101 (VK45.01 (P)) and designed a suitable turret. The turret was built by Krupp.(17.13). This design eventually turned into the Ferdinand (Elephant) tank destroyer (see under Porsche Typ 101 engine).</p>

<p>Henschel competed for the same contract to design a tank mounting the 88 mm L56 gun. When Porsche redesigned their VK 30.01(P) into the VK45.01(P) for this contract, Henschel redesigned their VK36.01(H) to become the heavier VK45.

  <p>This engine was used in numerous armoured vehicles, including the Pz. Kpfw. III (Ausf. d-n), the Pz. Kpfw. IV (Ausf. b-j), and their many derivatives, in the Ferdinand tank destroyer (Panzerjäger Tiger (P)), the Waffenträger prototypes (Hummel/Wespe SPG), in later versions of the Sd. Kfz. 9 heavy halftrack, etc.</p>

  <p>The engine was a 60° V-12, four-stroke unit, with a tunnel type crankcase and seven roller main bearings, usually with a dry sump. It sported two overhead valves per cylinder, driven by a single, gear-driven, overhead camshaft per bank. Weight was approximately 940kg and the compression ratio was 6.5:1. Reported output varies a bit, depending on source, but typical was 300 metric hp at 3000 rpm and 265 hp at 2600 rpm continuously(18.1). Other sources give a maximum output 320 hp. Von Senger, for instance, gives 320 PS at 3000 rpm, with a maximum torque of 800 N.m.(18.2).</p>

  <p>The engine was usually fitted with two starters: an electric starter to use when the engine was warm and an inertia starter for use when the engine was started from cold. The inertia starter was accessed through the rear armour by means of a crank. A flywheel was then spun up, usually with two men on the crank. When the flywheel had reached about 60 rpm, the crank was removed and the clutch between the flywheel and engine engaged. The momentum of the flywheel then turned the engine over to start it. The HL210 and HL230 engines of the Panther and Tigers had similar starting systems(18.3).</p>

  <p>The Pz. Kpfw. IV was fitted with a small, two-stroke, auxiliary generator to keep the batteries charged(18.4). This improved starting with the self-starter. The Pz. Kpfw. III did not have this feature. As a further aid to cold starting on the Eastern front, a “Kühlwasserübertragung” was fitted. This allowed the cooling circuit of a warm engine to be connected to that of a cold engine in another tank and to heat the engine of this second vehicle by means of the hot cooling water(18.5).</p>

  <p>The HL120 is possibly the most prolific of the Maybach engines produced and was used in numerous vehicles(18.6).</p>

  <p>It is interesting to note that the Germans had access to a full range of engines between 90 and 700 hp. This was not the case with the Allies. Many engines were available up to about 150 hp, but between 150 hp and 350 hp, there was a distinct dearth of powerplants to power armoured vehicles in the Allied armies.</p>

  <p>In view of the extremely widespread use of the HL120, it is interesting to note that the Allies never developed a “conventional” 250-300 hp class engine for use in armoured vehicles, except the rather obscure 16 litre, flat-12, Meadows DAV engine used in the rather obscure Covenanter tank. They (Allies) did however make widespread use of radial aircraft engines of 250 hp and of 340-400 hp, and they had the excellent GM two-stroke diesel which varied between 135 and 210 hp, but because of the fuel policy, this engine saw relatively little use as a tank powerplant with the US and Commonwealth forces.</p>

  <p>To achieve the required power, the Allies (Americans) often made use of double engine installations, such as two Cadillac series 42 engines in the M24 light tank, two Hercules JXD engines in the T17 armoured car, two GMC 270 engines in the Staghound armoured car, two GMC 329 engines in the Boarhound armoured car and two GM Diesel 6-71 diesels in some Sherman tanks(18.7). </p>

<p>The British also built six prototypes of what was basically a copy of the German Sd. Kfz. 7 halftrack. This “Traclat” was powered by two, side by side, Bedford engines(18.8). The only twin engine installations used by the Germans, was the petrol-electric setup in Porsche’s proposal for the Tiger I. This was continued in the Ferdinand SPG.    </p>

<p>Three engines were proposed for the prototype of the VK 30.01(H). First choice was the V-12 Maybach HL190 of 400 hp at 2500. As a back-up, Maybach developed a big six-cylinder engine, the HL150. Finally, a more compact 6-cylinder motor was developed, the HL 116(19.1). The HL150 had the same 150 mm stroke as the HL 116 but the bore was increased to 150 mm. Two prototype engines were built but the engine saw no service use.</p>

<p>Both the HL 116 and the HL150 had 150mm strokes and had published maximum rpm in excess of 3000. This would have resulted in very high mean piston speed and there is good reason to believe that continuous rpm would have been substantially lower, if they had gone into production. Jentz states that the HL150 engine developed 400 metric hp(19.2) while Fröhlich mentions 320 hp(19.3). Horsepower is more or less proportional to rpm. It may be that the engine did indeed produce 400 hp at 3400 rpm on the test bench and that it produced 320 hp at a more realistic 2800 rpm, for instance.</p>

<p>This engine was intended for the VK16.02 light tank. This was to be a fast, 22-ton reconnaissance tank, with production starting in 1943, but it was cancelled before even one prototype was produced. It is not clear whether a prototype of this engine actually ever ran.</p>

<p>The output of 35 hp/litre is very high, but the BMEP and hp/litre/1000 rpm figures are similar to those of the contemporary HL210 and would have been achievable. The high output is mainly due to the high maximum rpm. At 3500 rpm, the mean piston speed would have been 14.6 m/s, similar to the 14.5 m/s of the Maybach HL230 at 3000 rpm. That engine could not tolerate the high rpm however and its maximum RPM had to be limited to 2500 rpm. In practice, the HL157 would probably have developed about 450 hp at 3000 rpm (20.1).</p>

<p>As described in the section for the HL115, Wa Prüf 6 requested Krupp to design a new turret with 10 cm thick armour, to house a 105 mm L/28 gun. In mid-1940, Wa Prüf 6 ordered Henschel to redesign the Durchbruchswagen (D.W.) hull to mount the new turret. The new tank was to be powered by a drive train consisting of a 12-cylinder engine, the Maybach HL174, delivering 450 hp, driving through an eight-speed Maybach Olvar 40 12 16 transmission and Henschel L600 steering gear and final drives. The weight of the tank would be around 36 tons and the proposed prototype became known as the VK36.01. Only a single VK36.01 chassis was built and the design developed into the VK45.01(H), which became the Tiger I. Maybach Motorenwerk reported that only two HL174 engines were built in 1942(21.1).</p>

<p>Most sources state that the bore and stroke for the HL174 were 125x130 mm, for a displacement of 19144 cc(21.2).  This would however not conform to the standard nomenclature used by Maybach for their engines, and 450 hp from a 19-litre engine is rather mediocre, if one compares it with the other late model V-12 engines from Maybach. Jentz suggests a maximum output of 500 hp and 28.7 hp/litre. This presupposes a displacement of 17.4 litres. The bore and stroke given in the table (115x140), for a displacement of 17.4 litres, are a “guestimate”.</p>

<p>The actual output of the engine is also not quite clear. Jentz suggests both 450 hp and 500 hp, while Chamberlain states 550 hp(21.3). An output of 550 hp is unlikely as that would result in well over 30 hp/litre. In the table, 500 hp at 3000 rpm is used while calculations are based on 450 hp at 3000 rpm in this section.</p>

<p>It seems that there has been some confusion about the data for the HL174 and the HL190 in the past and that this has been propagated afterwards by many authors. Both of these engines were only produced in very small numbers; they were basically developmental engines.</p>

<p>Little data available for this engine. Jentz states that is was suggested as a possible powerplant for a proposed 30 ton tank in 1935(22.1). He gives the power as 375 PS for an output of 19.7 hp/litre, with no further details as to bore and stroke(22.2). Von Senger und Etterlin states that the engine weighed 1200 kg, displaced 19 litres and developed 400 PS(22.3).</p>

<p>The bore, stroke and even the displacement are not clear. Most authors state that the bore and stroke of the HL174 were 125x130 mm. This equates to a displacement of 19144 cc and were probably the bore and stroke of the HL190.</p>

<p>The maximum rpm stated for the HL190 is low, at 2400, as is the power output, as one can expect from an engine from that era.</p>

<p>The HL190 was a candidate to power the Henschel VK 30.01 but the prototype of this vehicle finally received the more compact HL 116(17.2).</p>

<p>Development of this 60° V-12 started in June 1941. It is probable that the decision of Henschel to upgrade the VK30.01 to the VK36.01, in May 1941, led Maybach to develop this engine. The first pre-production engines were delivered to Henschel and MAN in February 1942; an extremely short development cycle. The first tank to be fitted with this engine was the Tiger Mod. E (Tiger I). The first prototype of this tank took to the road in April 1942, followed by 5 more in June 1942(23.1). These vehicles were fitted with the HL210 TRM P45 engine:</p>

<p>The version used in the first batch of Panther Ausf. D tanks differed in some details from the Tiger version and was known as the HL210 P30, the “P30” signifying a 30 ton tank. The first Panther (Ausf. D) was delivered in January 1943.</p>

<p>The HL210 engine consisted of a cast aluminium crankcase with steel cylinder liners and cast iron heads. It was a very compact unit for the amount of power it delivered, being just over 1.2 metres (48 inches) long, 97 cm. (38 inches) wide and 94 cm (37 inches) high, excluding the air-cleaners. The short-block weighed about 800 kg. With all accessories attached, the weight was about 1050 kg. The compression ratio was 6.8:1(23.2).</p>

<p>The HL210 engine was used in the first 250 Tiger I tanks and the first 250 Panther tanks. It was then replaced in production by the HL230. The engine was fed by four Solex, down draught carburettors (JFF 2) which draw combustion air through 3 Mahle, vortex type air-filters, with oil baths. The 3 air-filters distinguish the HL 210 from the later HL 230 which only had two air-filters on top in the Tiger and a single, large, combined unit in the Panther. Fuel was supplied by 4 mechanical fuel pumps. In addition, an electrical as well as a manual priming pump was available. Two overhead valves per cylinder were actuated by a single overhead camshaft per bank. The camshafts were gear driven. One spark plug per cylinder was supplied by one ignition magneto per bank, i.e two, six-wire magnetos. The oil tank for the dry sump lubrication system contained 28 litres of oil and the oil was cooled via an oil-water heat exchanger. The engine was fitted with a 24 volt electric starter as well as an inertia starter which could be swung by a crank handle through the rear wall of the engine compartment(23.3).</p>

<p>The HL210 engine had a very high output per displacement and BMEP for an engine from this era. Power at maximum rpm was 650 metric hp. It soon became clear, as in the case of its HL230 derivative, that the engine was not reliable or durable at 3000 rpm and the maximum rpm was limited to 2600 rpm. Maximum continuous power was about 570 hp at 2600 rpm(23.4).</p>

<p>Installed in one or two prototype VK 65.01 chassis. Three prototypes of this large tank were ordered in September 1939. The initial prototype was to be powered by a Maybach HL320 and the following two by an even larger HL 360 engine. The specifications of these engines are not known. Eventually, only one or two mild steel prototypes were completed in mid-1941, powered by the HL224 engine. The tank was notable for the ability to be broken down into 3 sections for rail transport: the driver and co-driver compartment and transmission in the front section, the fighting compartment with turret in the centre section and the rear section containing the engine(24.1).</p>

<p>The bore, stroke and displacement of the HL224 are usually stated to be (125x145) with a displacement of 21.4 litres, i.e. identical to that of the HL210(24.2). This confusing situation is also seen with the other large, experimental Maybach engines, i.e. the Maybach HL174 and the HL190: all available sources state that the bore and stroke of the HL174 was 125x130 mm which equals 19.1 litres; no displacement figures are available for the HL 190, and the HL224 is stated to have an identical displacement to the HL210. These numbers are almost certainly incorrect. If the engine conformed to the normal Maybach designation, the bore and stroke of the HL224 would have been 130x140, with a displacement of 22.3 litres.</p>

<p>Note: For the greatest part of its career, the HL230 produced about 575 hp at 2500 rpm. If the figure is used, the following specifications are true: Power: 428 Kw (575 hp) at 2500 rpm. 25 hp/litre; 10 hp/litre/1000 rpm.</p>

<p>It soon became clear that the Tiger I was under-powered with the HL210 engine. The engine compartment in the tank was however designed around the very compact HL210 engine and it would not have been possible to fit a physically larger engine without a major redesign of the hull and engine compartment. To address this problem, the HL230 engine was developed. It was derived from the HL210, by replacing the aluminium engine block of this engine by a heavier and more rigid cast iron block, and increasing the bore to 130mm. This raised the displacement from 21.35 litres to 23.1 litres. The engine had the same configuration as the HL210, with some differences in the positions of the magneto’s, the air cleaners, etc(25.1). At around 1400 kg it was substantially heavier than the aluminium HL210. Compression ratio initially was 6.8:1, later reduced to 6.4:1.</p>

<p>Like the HL210, the HL230 was a dry sump engine. The oil reservoir was a 28 litre tank fitted low down, on the right side of the engine. Oil circulation was maintained by a single pressure pump and two scavenge pumps that returned oil from the sump to the oil tank. As in the HL210, the oil was cooled by an oil-water heat exchanger. An interesting feature of the HL230 was that it had a valve through which lines from the two fuel pumps passed on their way to the four carburettors situated in the V. An oil line also passed through the valve mechanism. If the oil pressure dropped below a certain level, the valve would close and shut off the fuel flow, ensuring that the engine stopped before serious damage could ensue.</p>

<p>The two starters, one electric (24 volt) and one inertia, were mounted on the side of the engine, in front of the oil tank. According to the handbook, the engine had to be started using the inertia starter when it was cold. The electric starter was only intended for use with a warm engine.</p>

<p>To use the inertia starter, a crank handle was passed through the armour at the rear of the tank. It engaged a gear and shaft system that connected it to the inertia starter. The shaft actually passed through a tunnel in the oil tank on its way to the starter. The flywheel of the inertia starter was spun up with the crank handle. The handle was then disengaged and a lever situated next to the crank opening in the rear armour pulled to engage the flywheel to the engine(25.2).</p>

<p>The HL230 engine required 30 litres of engine oil while the Maybach Olvar gearbox and the steering gear required another 30 litres of oil. The final drives, turret drives and fan drives required a further 57 litres of oil(25.3).</p>

<p>The HL230 replaced the HL210 in production in May 1943, in both the Panther Ausf. D and the Tiger I(25.4). The first 250 Tigers were fitted with the HL210 engine. After this the HL230 was fitted. When the earlier tanks required new engines, the HL210 units were replaced by HL230 ones. This involved some modification of the engine compartment, especially of the cooling fan drives. Kits were supplied to enable these replacements to be performed in the field.</p>

<p>Various versions of the engine were used in the late production Tiger I, the Tiger model B (Tiger II/King Tiger) and its derivatives, like the Sturmtiger, various versions of the Panther and its derivatives (Jagdpanther; Bergepanther, etc.). It was also intended for future projects such as the Panther II and the E-100, at least initially(25.5).</p>

<p>In all the German tanks, the engine was situated at the back while the transmission was fitted at the front of the vehicle, between the driver and co-driver/radio operator. German tank designers felt that this gave better weight distribution than with a complete powerpack at the back of the vehicle. It also allowed the engine compartment to be shorter and the turret to be mounted further back on the vehicle which, in the case of a long main gun, gave less gun overhang. Finally, it was felt that having the drive sprocket at the front of the vehicle gave certain advantages, such as reduced wear and tear of the sprocket because the track was cleaner by the time it reached the sprocket. The US also followed these design principles in the Sherman, the M2 and M3, etc., until the introduction of the M26. This had the engine, gearbox, steering gear, final drives and drive sprockets at the rear.</p>

<p>The biggest disadvantage of a rear engine with a front mounted gear box is that a drive shaft has to pass from the engine to the gearbox, passing underneath the turret basket. The overall height of the vehicle is inevitably increased by this construction. In tanks with a transverse torsion bar suspension, such as the German “big cats”, the drive shaft also has to pass over the torsion bars and under the turret basket, potentially raising the height even more.</p>

<p>In the Panther, the engine was coupled to ZF AK 7-200 transmission. This was a full syncromesh, manual gearbox with 7 speeds forward and one reverse gear. The gearbox was rated for a maximum of 800 PS and maximum torque of 1750 N.m. With the three disc dry clutch, it weighed 750 Kg. This gearbox proved to be generally effective, easy to use and reliable in the Panther(25.6).</p>

<p>In the Tiger Ausf. E (Tiger I), the HL230 was coupled to a Maybach Olvar 40 12 16A semi-automatic, hydraulically shifted gearbox, with eight forward and four reverse gears. In the Tiger Ausf. B (Tiger II), the engine was coupled to a similar Maybach Olvar 40-20-16B gearbox(25.7).</p>

<p>In November 1942, the prototypes of the Porsche Tiger and the Henschel Tiger were evaluated against one another at Berka, in Thuringia. The Porsche vehicle was powered by two 10-cylinder, air-cooled, Porsche, petrol engines, built by Simmering-Graz-Pauker, while the Henschel vehicle was powered by the Maybach HL210. Both tanks were perceived to be under-powered and when asked, the Henschel team reported that they would soon receive the new “Maybach HL230 engine, of  750 metric hp”(25.8). The expectations for this engine were, as often seemed to be the case in Germany and especially with Maybach, unrealistically high. The engine finally went into production with a rating of 700 PS (690 hp) at 3000 rpm but ended up producing much less in service. Incidentally, the testing at Berka also showed that the consumption figures presented by both Maybach and Porsche for their engines were grossly optimistic.</p>

<p>Note: In the data section at the back of Jentz and Doyle’s book on the Tiger II, the output of the Maybach HL230 engine fitted in the Tiger Model B (Tiger II) is stated to be 750 hp at 3000 rpm. This is incorrect: all other sources, including Jentz and Doyle on their book on the Tiger Model E (Tiger I), state that the engine developed 700 metric hp at 3000 rpm.</p>

<p>Maybach did not keep separate records for the production of the HL210 and the HL230. The company produced 153 of the HL210/230 engines in 1942, 4346 in 1943, 2973 in 1944 and 987 in 1945. After a bombing raid in April 1944, production ceased and could only be restarted in October 1944. The engines were however also produced at other locations. Auto-Union, for instance, produced 4366 engines during 1944 and 1945. After producing about 800 engines per month in mid-1944, they were also bombed in September, reducing production to less than 300 engines per month during the following 2 months(25.9). It is estimated that a total of about 9000 HL210 and HL230 engines were produced during the war.</p>

<p>The rapid development, with inadequate testing, of the HL230, resulted in very poor reliability initially. Broken connecting rods, bearing failure, cylinder head gasket failures and a plethora of other problems were common. Spontaneous engine fires were also common, due to leaks in the fuel system, especially the fuel pumps. The lifespan of an engine was initially only 700-1000 km in the Panther.</p>

<p>In November 1943, the governors of all HL230 engines were reset to limit RPM to a maximum of 2500 in an effort to increase reliability and longevity. This limited output to less than 600 hp. In the course of 1944, the engine  was further modified, including being fitted with an extra main bearing, new types of bearings, a new piston design and the compression ratio was lowered from 6.8:1 to 6.4:1, because of repeated head gasket failures, amongst other modifications. By the end of 1944, the HL230 engine’s reliability was approaching that of the other Maybach engines, like the HL120. The life-expectancy of the engines had doubled, to 1500-2000 kilometres, on average(25.10).</p>

<p>Many publications state that the engine produced “about 600 hp” at its reduced rate of 2500 rpm. It is interesting that von Heydekampf noted, in the final meeting of the Panzer Commission, in January 1945, that the engine only developed 540 hp at 2500 rpm(25.11). In 1949, France started production of the somewhat anachronistic ARL 44 tank. This vehicle was also powered by the Maybach HL230 engine. According to this tank’s specifications, the engine developed 575 hp (presumably metric hp)(25.12). These figures show that both the Panther and especially the Tiger were grossly under-powered and a far cry from the 750 hp initially projected by Maybach.</p>

<p>This was a fuel injected, improved, and strengthened version of the HL230, retaining the same bore, stroke and displacement. The carburettors were already recognised as a weak point of the HL230 in 1943 and development of a fuel injected version was started. As other problems with the engine appeared, improvements and modifications were designed into the new engine. It was strengthened all over, with improved connecting rods and rod bearing, modified main bearings, head gaskets, inlet and exhaust manifolds, improved cylinder head cooling, Belville washer type valve springs, etc.</p>
<p>The direct fuel injection increased maximum power and improved fuel consumption, especially at partial loading. The head gasket consisted of an iron ring combined with rubber rings instead of the copper rings used in the HL230. Repeated failures of the head gaskets was the main reason why the compression ratio of the Maybach HL230 engine had to be reduced from 6.8:1 to 6.4:1. Some of the problems encountered with the head gaskets were solved by incorporating solutions found in the British Meteor engine(26.1). Cooling water flow paths were improved and the water pumps enlarged to help cope with the increased heat production of the more powerful engine. The HL230 was initially fitted with 7 main bearings. Early in 1944, an eighth bearing was added and in the HL234, another bearing was built in outside the flywheel so that the crankshaft ran in 9 main bearings(26.2).</p>
<p>The engine was at an advanced stage of development by the end of the war. Production was intended to start by the middle of 1945.</p>
<p>During post-war interrogation, Von Heydekampf mentioned that the aim of the HL234 program was to improve the output of the HL230 engine from 650 PS to 800 PS, mainly through the introduction of fuel injection and increasing the compression ratio. Later, the output would be further increased to 900 PS by means of supercharging. In September 1944, Maybach sent a report to Wa Prüf 6 on the status of development of their tank engines. They also mentioned that they expected the HL234 to develop “at least” 800 metric hp at 3000 rpm. (26.3).</p>
<p>In a meeting of the Panzer Kommission (Entwicklungskommission Panzer), in January 1945, it was reported that the engine had achieved 900 PS (887 imperial hp; 660 Kw). This equates to almost 40 metric hp/litre and a BMEP of over 11.5 Bar. These are very high numbers, for an engine running on 74 octane petrol. During post-war interrogation of Dipl. Ing. Kniepkamp, he also referred to 900 PS being achieved, and Von Senger und Etterlin also mentions 900 PS normally aspirated, with 1100-1200 PS expected, with supercharging. In Potthoff & Schmid’s book on Wunibald Kamm, 660 Kw (885 hp) is mentioned as the output of the normally aspirated HL234.</p>
<p>Kamm’s firm, F.K.F.S., was involved with the development of the Sla-16 turbocharged diesel engine (see later). F.K.F.S. was apparently also developing a turbocharged version of the Maybach HL234, the HL234K, a prototype of which was nearing completion in 1945. This engine was expected to develop as much as 800 Kw (1075 hp)(26.4).</p>
<p>Kniepkamp stated that an HL234 engine had been installed in a Tiger II tank, for trials, but that the installation of all ancillaries had not been completed before the end of the war(26.5).</p>
<p>It is unclear if the 900 PS quoted by everybody for the normally aspirated version of the HL 234 was actually demonstrated, or was hearsay on the basis of claims by Prof. Maybach. Von Heydekampf felt that the engine could achieve 900 hp with conventional supercharging and, as mentioned, a turbocharged version was also being developed by F.K.F.S. Aside from the conventionally supercharged version, another supercharged version of the HL234 was however also planned which, according to Kniepkamp, was projected to have developed 1200 hp. The supercharger would not have been driven by the engine itself but would have been powered by a separate, 2-cylinder, supercharged engine, developing 70 hp. The small engine, a Maybach HL 10, two cylinder, four-stroke engine of 1.09 litre displacement, would have been mounted in the V of the V-12. It would have driven a large supercharger which would then supercharge both the small engine itself  as well as the main engine. The supercharger would therefore run at a constant speed, providing continuous, stable, high, manifold pressure, independent of the revolutions of the main engine(26.5).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that this principle was revived in the 1980s, with the French Leclerc MBT. This tank is fitted with the SACM VBX-1500 engine, consisting of a 16.5 litre, V-8 diesel, supercharged with a Turbomeca TM 307 gas turbine. The gas turbine functions as an auxiliary power unit as well as providing continuous supercharging to the diesel engine, regardless of the engine revolutions. This enables the engine to produce a maximum of 1500 hp at 2500 rpm, for a spectacular 90 hp/litre displacement and a BMEP of over 30 Bar! This was unheard of for a diesel engine in the mid-eighties when the Leclerc was developed. The MB 873 Ka-501 of the Leopard 2 tank, from the same era, also developes 1500 hp but this was generated by a conventionally turbocharged, 12 cylinder diesel of 47.6 litres(26.6).</p>
<p>It is notable how the performance expectations of Von Heydekampf and of Kniepkamp for the HL234 engine differed. Von Heydekampf obviously referred to conventional supercharging rather than the esoteric setup Kniepkamp referred to. At 900 hp, the BMEP of the unsupercharged HL234 would have been 11,85 Bar. If the supercharged version, as described by Kniepkamp, had materialised and if the performance had equalled expectations (1200 hp), the power to displacement ratio would have been 52 hp/l and the BMEP would have been 15.8 Bar.</p>
<p>Taking everything into account, especially the performance of other, similar technology, petrol engines ( RR Meteor, the Continental AV 1790 and the Maybach HL 295), it is unlikely that the HL234 would have developed more than 800 to 850 PS at 3000 rpm, normally aspirated. With conventional supercharging, it would probably have produced about 900-950 hp. Kamm expected their turbocharged version to develop over 1000 hp and this sounds reasonable. Also see the notes on the Maybach HL 295.</p>

<p>In September 1939, three prototypes of a 65 ton tank was ordered from Henschel (chassis) and Krupp (turret), the PzKpw VII (VK 65.01). The first of the prototypes would have been powered by a Maybach HL320 engine and the following two by even larger HL 360 petrol engines. In August 1940, the order for the VK 65.01 was cancelled. The one or two  completed prototype chassis were powered by HL224 engines. It is doubtful if an HL320 engine was ever completed(27.1).</p>

<p>This engine was a post-war development at the request of France. There possibly was a prototype of this engine present in the factory at the end of the war. A blueprint of the engine, dated September 1945, exists(28.1). There was no mention of this engine in German WW2 notes however, for instance in the minutes of a meeting of the Panzer Commission, in January 1945. Friedrichshafen, where the main Maybach factory was located, lay in the French zone of occupation. The French started a tank development program after WW2 and in September 1946 they contracted Maybach to develop a 1000 hp engine for them. A few months later, a team of Maybach engineers (Gruppe M) transferred to Vernon, in France, where development of the engine started(28.2).</p>

<p>There is an example of the engine in the collection of the WTS museum, in Koblenz, in Germany(28.3).</p>

<p>The engine was used in prototypes of the post-war French AMX 50. It was a fuel injected unit, based on the HL234, and was expected to develop 900-1000 hp normally aspirated and up to 1200 hp with supercharging. Despite concerted efforts by the Maybach engineers, it apparently never produced more than about 860 hp however (29.1 hp/litre), and a supercharged version never materialised. Only 10-15 of these engines were built. The failure of this engine to achieve the projected performance is described as “an embarrassing  failure” by the Maybach engineers, according to some authors(28.4).</p>

<p>It should be noted however that the achieved performance conformed to that of other similar sized, petrol-fuelled, tank engines. The fuel-injected version of the Rolls Royce Meteor engine of 27 litre displacement developed 810 hp in the post-war Conqueror tank (30 hp/l). The Ford GAC, a V-12 derivative of the V-8 GAA/GAN/GAF engines, also displaced 27 litres but was fuelled by carburettors. It developed 770hp at its peak (28.5 hp/l), in the late 1940s. The post-war, fuel-injected, Continental AV-1790 engine of 29.3 litre displacement developed 810 hp (27.6 hp/l) in the M46, M47 and M48 tanks. One cannot but conclude that the projections for the big Maybach engine may have been unrealistic. The experience with this engine also makes the claim that the normally aspirated 23 litre Maybach HL234 achieved 900 PS, highly questionable</p>

<p>This engine was used in the Type 62 and type 82 KdF Wagen (Volkswagen saloon car), the Type 82, Kfz.1, “Kübelwagen” and the Type 166 Schwimmwagen. It initially displaced 986cc and developed 23.5 hp. In 1941, an enlarged, 1130 cc version, which produced 25 hp, was developed but it only became common in 1943(29.1).</p>

<p>Notable are the bore and stroke of the engine; it is clearly over-square, with the bore larger than the stroke. At that time, this was unusual; most engines were under-square (stroke longer than the bore diameter). In an evaluation of an early model Kübelwagen, captured in the North-African desert, the engineering department of Humber Ltd., in the UK, noted that it is “a short stroke engine, the stroke-to-bore ratio being 0.91:1 compared to an average ratio of 1.45 to 1 in the UK and 1.25 to 1 in the US”. They found the compression ratio to be 5.2:1(29.2).</p>

<p>After the war, the VW factory was resurrected under Major Ivan Hirst of the British Army. Initially, the factory produced VW type 1 (Beetle) cars for the British Army but later similar cars were produced for civilian use. These cars were all initially powered by the 25 hp, 1131 cc engine introduced during the war(29.3)</p>
